00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Hi I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash Course
Games.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,920
Today, we’re going to talk about a genre of games that has really boomed in the past couple decades: open world games.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:17,240
I’m talking about the ones in which you can spend hours discovering every dark alley of a city, exploring a magical fantasy world, completing aimless quests, or even just choosing what you want your character to wear.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,300
We’re going to learn how these games are time capsules in that they reflect the capabilities of their hardware.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,480
And while they aren’t necessarily story-driven, we'll learn why they encourage us to redefine what narrative means and how they appeal to the social being and the explorer in all of us.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,380
Unless you don’t know how to control it
and you just keep running into walls constantly.

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:42,580
[Theme Music]

8
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,000
Open World Games are video games that take
place in large, explorable worlds.

9
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,590
The player chooses to partake in tons of optional
activities, rather than one clear, set path.

10
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,130
Some of those pursuits relate to an overarching
goal or story and others don’t.

11
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,710
And many can be completed in a nonlinear way.

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,200
These games don't have a required genre – we’re going to be talking about RPGs, action adventure, fantasy, and more.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,080
We also have “sandbox games” whose definition
continues to be debated in the gamer community.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,640
Some view “sandbox games” as actually falling under the category of “open world games” and some see them as two interchangeable terms.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,620
Author Carolyn Handler Miller explains her perceived difference between a “sandbox game” and an “open-world game” in the book Digital Storytelling.

16
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:32,560
She writes, “When distinctions are made between open world and sandbox games, sandbox games are regarded as a ‘toy box’ that contains tools that players can use to modify the game world and gameplay.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,200
Instead of containing set story elements like an open world game, players can construct a narrative while playing, creating an emergent story.”

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,400
This brings us to another important term in this genre: an “emergent story” is when a narrative becomes clear to the player, but it wasn’t written or planned that way.

19
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,340
You can view it as a sort of improvisation that occurs between the player and the sandbox world they’ve been given.

20
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,980
The people who created the game didn’t plan
a story, but the individual interprets one.

21
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,540
This can also happen in multi-player games (think the MMORPGs we’ve discussed – people get together and make an emergent story).

22
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:08,980
And, as Miller notes, “Despite all the recent attention, the concept of emergence is still quite ambiguous and undefined in games.”

23
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:15,120
So, in this video, when I refer to a “sandbox game,” I’m talking about one with a lack of story and no clear end goal.

24
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,120
You can have an “open world game” that’s not “sandbox,” but all “sandbox games” take place in an open world.

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,560
Now, I’ve been talking primarily in video game terms so far, but this genre has origins outside of those.

26
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,200
As you know from watching this series, gaming devices and consoles haven’t always had the capability to handle games like Fallout 4.

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,939
But, people have always enjoyed emergent gameplay.

28
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:37,439
It really started, in this context, with the
interactive fiction boom of the 1980s.

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,580
There was the text-based computer game, Zork, created by MIT students, which was popular throughout the decade.

30
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,040
In the game, you’d type in commands for your character to uncover a story piece by piece.

31
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,760
Another text-based, interactive fiction game was the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy game, released in 1984 for computers and Atari.

32
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,740
And, even before that, board games like Cosmic Encounter and RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons gave people the opportunity to create emergent narratives.

33
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:06,620
These games all have one thing in common: they give people an amount of control over the stories and the gaming experience.

34
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:13,440
In the 1990s, popular graphic adventure PC and video games came out, like Myst, another predecessor to open-world games.

35
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:23,459
Another forerunner was the Ultima series, which ran from 1980 to 1999, and often gets credit for being the first RPG set in an open world while incorporating a vivid narrative.

36
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:30,300
Then, some 3D open world games started popping up, like Super Mario 64, Body Harvest, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

37
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,060
Or is it Ocarina of Time?
[pronunciation: "oh" vs "ah"]

38
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,880
It’s always been a big debate.
You probably know.

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,680
Now, Super Mario 64 might not be what you think of when you think open world game, but as scholar Henry Jenkins notes,

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,900
“I’ve always felt Mario 64 is the greatest sandbox game ever made because of its ingenious non-linear level design.

41
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,820
Levels in Mario 64 do not rely on multiple paths but instead allow for improvisational play based on a simple, elegant rule set.”

42
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:59,639
Now it’s a little confusing, but worth pointing out that his definition of “sandbox game” differs from Carolyn Miller’s; as I said, these terms are still being shaped.

43
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,000
Anyway, in a response to Jenkins,
his colleague Chris Kohler adds,

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,020
“[Mario 64] also has emergent gameplay in the sense that a player can come up with ways to get around its challenges that even the developers never thought of, but which are not bugs.”

45
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:19,060
In 1999, two open-world games were released that allowed players to drive wherever they wanted to go: Driver and Crazy Taxi.

46
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,200
And the same year, Shenmue was released for
the Sega Dreamcast.

47
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,860
Shenmue’s open world is often compared to the one in Grand Theft Auto III, but it came first.

48
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,580
There was a lot of hype – at the time, people believed it cost about $70 million to develop though it’s now thought to be closer to $47 million.

49
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,710
It’s still a lot.

50
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,800
The game was set in modern Japan and was an open, explorable world featuring a harbor, bars, shopping areas, and villages.

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,200
There were details that were monumental for games at the time, like weather changes, communication with a bunch of characters, and the ability to closely observe and interact with objects.

52
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,780
The graphics were pretty spectacular, too.

53
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,540
Already, you can see how gaming devices needed to significantly progress in order for these games to develop.

54
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,300
Zork was originally written for the massive PDP-10 - a computer that was typically used in universities.

55
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,800
Not really something the average American
could access.

56
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,840
And even the later installments of Zork that did run on home computers were simple and based on text commands.

57
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:14,120
The open-world style seen in Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Shenmue required more complex gaming devices to achieve that truly immersive feel.

58
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,949
And a great example of this was 2001’s Grand
Theft Auto III, an important release for Sony.

59
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,760
The game exemplified the special features of the Playstation 2: better graphics and bigger storage.

60
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,540
There was a plot, but players were given tons
of freedom.

61
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,460
They could explore the 3D world, which was
an entire city with three districts.

62
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,140
They also had the option of following the main plot, or veering off into side missions and adventures.

63
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,900
While some earlier games gave players control of the order of the missions, this game combined that freedom with the alternative of just exploring.

64
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,000
Rockstar, the company that released Grand Theft Auto III, or GTA III, even gets credit for inventing the term “sandbox game.”

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,570
Now, I’m going to jump forward to more modern
games.

66
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,090
I want to talk about these in terms of impact
on players.

67
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,350
We’re going to look at them from two different
perspectives:

68
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,550
how they operate as social constructs and
as venues for exploration.

69
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,780
Two good examples of open-world games that involve social dynamics are EVE Online and World of Warcraft.

70
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,520
In these games, players form their own communites
that include economies.

71
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,440
They’re great examples of emergent narratives.

72
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,700
But, we already talked about them, so if these MMORPGs are of interest to you, check out the episode on that.

73
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,640
And there’s a newer open world game that incorporates socialization: Minecraft, which was released in 2011.

74
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,080
Now, it’s one of the best-selling PC games
of all time.

75
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,439
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

76
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,660
Minecraft was created by Swedish video game
designer Markus Persson aka Notch.

77
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,540
He cited other sandbox games as influences, including Dungeon Keeper, Infiniminer, and Dwarf Fortress.

78
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,780
And, surprise surprise, he loved Lego growing
up.

79
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:47,240
In 2009, Persson posted an unfinished version of Minecraft to gaming portal TIGSource, while working as a programmer at on online-photo sharing service called jAlbum.

80
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,860
Minecraft was officially released in 2011.

81
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,700
By 2012, it had sold 5.3 million copies, making
it the 6th best-selling PC game ever.

82
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,640
It currently sits at number one with 24 million
copies sold.

83
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:06,520
And thanks to additional console and mobile versions, it’s also one of the best-selling games of all time right up there with Wii Sports and Tetris.

84
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,180
Minecraft is the epitome of a sandbox game.

85
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,700
Players can choose to do basically whatever
they want.

86
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,960
Though, there are different modes.

87
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,320
If you’ve never played it, the world is made up of lego-like blocks – everything is constructible and de-constructible.

88
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
You can play solo or multi-player.

89
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,490
In the latter, you get to work with others
to create a structure from scratch.

90
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,530
Calling it a “game” doesn’t fully describe
the cooperative experience.

91
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,479
You are literally building a world together
with your friends.

92
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,310
That’s more than just gameplay, that’s
a complete and unique social relationship.

93
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,090
As journalist Clive Thompson puts it, “It
doesn’t really feel like a game.

94
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,710
It’s more like a destination, a technical
tool, a cultural scene, or all three put together.”

95
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,610
In other words, games like Minecraft and MMORPGs
are redefining what “play” means.

96
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,950
But, perhaps that’s not as new as it seems.

97
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:55,220
As Thompson notes, the game echoes the early days of personal computers in which young people collaborated and learned to code together.

98
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,340
Maybe playing Minecraft is similar to those
MIT students creating the first iteration of Zork.

99
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,480
Thanks Thought Bubble.

100
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,740
Kurt Squire of the University of Wisconsin-Madison has studied open-world video games to determine how people learn by playing them.

101
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:15,420
In research published in 2008, Squire makes an interesting observation about how young people play Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas varies depending on the context.

102
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:22,159
For example, when one 12-year-old participant described gameplay to the researchers, he said he spent much of his time designing and driving cars.

103
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,900
But, when his friends were in the room, he spent more time talking about the violence he could enact.

104
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:33,620
Squire writes, “Game play itself was a performance, one that arose in context, shaped – in part – by the other participants in the gaming experience

105
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,340
(such as those who might be huddled around the television watching).

106
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,820
These experiences suggest that, for players,
there is no one game that is played.

107
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,100
Different game-play models and experiences
are activated by play in different contexts.”

108
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:52,080
So the people around us can affect HOW we play open world games – whether that’s cooperation in Minecraft or showing off to our friends in GTA.

109
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,420
And while you might get similar results to Squire’s research with all types of games, there's more freedom in open world games.

110
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,320
The format allows people to really show their
different facets.

111
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,250
Moving on from games that emphasize socialization
to ones that pique curiosity and require exploration.

112
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:11,360
There’s the The Elder Scrolls series, an open-world, fantasy RPG, created in the mid-90s by Bethesda Game Studios.

113
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,620
Skyrim, the fifth installment in the series
was released to rave reviews in 2011.

114
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,740
There is a plotline, but the game features an extremely open world, so you don’t have to follow the narrative if you don’t want to, and there’s plenty to explore.

115
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,240
Then, there’s the Fallout series, which has been released by multiple studios since the late-90s.

116
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,100
Fallout 4 came out in 2015 from Bethesda.

117
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,940
It takes place in a post-apocalyptic version
of Boston.

118
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,020
And not only can you explore and do quests, like Skyrim, you can create your own structures and houses, sort of like Minecraft.

119
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,620
And, of course, your character is completely
modifiable.

120
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,160
Something that sets Skyrim and Fallout apart from many other console games are modifications or mods.

121
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,300
In 2016, mods were released by Bethesda for
Fallout 4 on Xbox.

122
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:57,080
Like the PC mods we’ve discussed in this series, players can now on a console install user-created mods onto their games – weapons, quests, even cheats.

123
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,080
You can imagine how mods would be especially appealing to players who choose games that center around exploration.

124
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,860
These are people who prefer to create their own gaming experience – without having to strictly adhere to a storyline.

125
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,960
A more recent example of a sandbox game is
No Man’s Sky.

126
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,420
Every player starts the game with a broken
spaceship on a planet, chosen at random.

127
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,010
From there, you can wander and hunt resources,
travelling from planet to planet.

128
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,500
The game has no narrative, but there is a “goal” for interested players: reach the center of the universe where a mystery may be revealed.

129
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,079
So the game is solely about exploration and
discovery of the planets and its inhabitants.

130
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,319
According to Jake Swearingen of New York Magazine,

131
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,280
“Within the first night of the game’s release, players had already discovered over 10 million species of living things – more than we know about on our own planet.”

132
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,680
There’s no way to know where the open-world
genre is headed.

133
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,720
We’re talking about something that’s going to continue to experience huge innovation for years to come.

134
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,300
And as future you is lining up for the latest
versions of Grand Theft Auto and Fallout

135
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,660
(or waiting for their Amazon package to arrive,
probably by drone)

136
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,120
take some time to reflect on everything open-world
games have taught us about ourselves.

137
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,600
We can create our own narratives, through
emergent stories.

138
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,240
We can learn about and develop our own interests and priorities – whether that be socializing in Minecraft, exploring a vacant planet in No Man’s Sky,

139
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,220
following a pre-existing storyline in Shenmue, or just stealing a car in Grand Theft Auto III.
