00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,889
Hi! I'm Andre Meadows, and this is Crash Course Games. In this series, we're going

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:08,280
to look at everything from the ancient
games depicted on cave walls, to board games,

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,560
to the rise of the arcade machine, to
home consoles, to virtual reality,

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,380
to role playing games and, hey nerds, even sports
-- all games are created equal.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,500
Games are used in schools and to treat medical conditions. They were used to train warriors for combat.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,900
Some games have international tournaments, some even have very real political consequences.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,760
There are games that you can play alone
(tear)

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,080
And there are games that millions of people at a time can play together.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,740
Some of these create a world -- some even have their own economics! Gaming affects millions of

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,960
players all over the world and makes an 
impact on popular culture and... "culture" culture!

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,480
I've got as many interesting game facts and stories for you as a Pokedex has  Pokemon.

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,740
How many Pokemon are there now? Like 850-something? After 151 I am done.

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,520
So sit back, hit the pause button on whatever you're playing and prepare for a multi pixel journey through

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,980
the history of games. And remember:
it's dangerous to go alone... take this!

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:10,220
[Theme Music]

16
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:16,160
Before we drop into all this like a
misplaced tetrad, tetrazoid, tetrazone, tetris piece

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,580
We need to orient ourselves. We should
answer a basic question: What is a game?

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,760
The dictionary will tell you 'a game
is a construct that organizes play

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,920
through a series of rules for the purpose of
achieving a set of goals overcoming an

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,040
obstacle and/or attaining an objective'.
That's a decent definition. I would call

21
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,440
games "entertainment" but they're a very
specific kind of "entertainment".

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,460
Game designer Chris Crawford came up
with a really cool hierarchy to explain this.

23
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,720
To start, Crawford characterizes any kind
of interactive entertainment as a play thing;

24
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,400
anything that you interact with to entertain yourself qualifies.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,260
But there are also two types of playthings:
a play thing without a goal like a slinky is a toy,

26
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,820
but when there's a goal involved like trying to get the slinky down the stairs, Crawford calls that a challenge.

27
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:08,240
Now if you're working to complete this challenge with no other active agent or person involved, it turns out you're working on a puzzle.

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,000
But when there is some kind of second party involved, then you have a conflict.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,320
Ok, we're almost there. Crawford subdivides
conflicts into competitions and games.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,980
In a competition the participants don't
interact or interfere with each other.

31
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,000
A good example of a competition is figure skating.
Everybody's skating to win but they

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,640
can't really affect each other's
performances.

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,540
Well, except for that one time with Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan but, you know, look it up.

34
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:40,800
Mario Kart though, now that's a game. Players interact continuously, blocking and passing, and there's no

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,220
clearer example of interference than when you're
in first place and one of your friends in 8th place

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,880
and they use a blue shell and take you out and take the leap. Why do you always do that to me, Katie?

37
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,960
It's not cool! And here's an
interesting thing to think about:

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,520
You don't have to be playing against a
person for something to be a game.

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,480
Those soldiers blocking your path in Metal
Gear are artificial intelligence or AI

40
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,790
agents trying to stop you from
accomplishing your goal.

41
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,070
The rules of solitaire can be
constructed as an agent working to stop you

42
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,320
from completing the game. So games have
goals like scoring points or saving the

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,000
princess and we achieve those goals by
following the rules,

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,280
like moving our game piece six places if we roll a six on the die or ending

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,820
our turn if we've spent all of our mana. Of course
none of this matters unless you want to play.

46
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:28,740
Voluntary participation is essential, otherwise it's work.
I'd also like to get at why we play games,

47
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,260
but that's a little harder. The short answer is,
there is no short answer. There is no

48
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,610
universal unified theory of why we play
games. There's no constitution of gaming,

49
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,580
no ten commandments of gaming. Different
games work on our brains in different ways.

50
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:49,120
Games like Tetris appeal to our desire to create order. Something like Animal Crossing lets us be the center of a whole tiny universe.

51
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,220
Games like World of Warcraft or Destiny
let us live a remarkable life in another world.

52
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,800
Games like Candy Crush lets us crush candy.
We play games for a lot of different reasons.

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,160
Let's leave behind the mystery of why we
play for a while and talk about what can

54
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,460
a game be and what can a game do. Take
video games.

55
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,480
Modern video games can be a bit
formulaic but recent technological

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,410
advances have made games available to a
wider audience and they've made the

57
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:20,200
tools to create games widely available
and that's well... a game-changer! Get it?

58
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,110
A game-changer! You see cause we're talking
games. A larger audience and a larger pool

59
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,360
of creators means a wider variety of
games that get produced. Sure, you'll get

60
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,700
Call of Duty and the annual licensed NFL
game that cost millions to make and sells millions

61
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,590
of copies but more gamers and lower
production and distribution costs means

62
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,810
quirky games like Braid or Super Meat Boy
or Shovel Knight. Games that might have

63
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,780
relatively small audiences can be
profitable and sometimes those quirky

64
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,370
independent games can get so profitable
and so popular that soon they hit a wide

65
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,440
audience just as much as a Triple A title.
And when I say wide audience I mean WIDE audience.

66
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,200
In the United States alone there are
around 145 million video game players.

67
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,040
37% of those players are over the age
of 36 and 18% are under 18.

68
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,180
That kind of breaks the gamers stereotype, doesn't it? And increasingly games are part of players' daily lives.

69
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,160
According to video game academic Jane McGonigal by 2010 the average video game player in the US

70
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:23,389
played for 22 hours a week. That's like watching
all the Harry Potter movies in order,

71
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,860
and then watching Chamber of Secrets again every week! That's a dedicated Harry Potter fan.

72
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,820
Clearly we're spending a lot of time playing video games so what's this doing to us?

73
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:40,920
We now have entire schools devoted to gaming and almost every major university offers classes and degrees related to games.

74
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,260
The University of Southern California, University of Utah, and Savannah College

75
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,480
of Art and Design all have renowned programs
in game art, programming, and design.

76
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,020
The gaming industry makes so much money. Even
more sometimes than movies and television!

77
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,610
There are even people right now on
YouTube

78
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,810
who are making a living playing video
games, on camera - that's a job! And it's not just

79
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,090
about learning how to make games or make
money off of games. Massively multiplayer

80
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,760
game worlds can provide insights across disciplines. Sociologists can study how people form groups.

81
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,140
Economists can finally see if their models work.

82
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,720
And in 2005 World of Warcraft became a legitimate
subject of study for epidemiologists.

83
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:24,150
Let's go to the Thought Bubble. In 2005 a plague hit
World of Warcraft. The game's developers

84
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,730
introduced a new mission that called on
players to defeat a boss named Hakkar the

85
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,790
Soulflayer, blood god of the Gurubashi trolls. Is Gurubashi right? Whatever.

86
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,680
When players attacked Hakkar, he cast a spell called Corrupted Blood, which drained the players hit points.

87
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,540
The spell was intended to be contagious but it was only supposed to spread in that part of the game.

88
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,770
Well, it turns out Corrupted Blood was kind
of like a real world pathogen and it got out of

89
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,680
the intended area and spread to the
entire game world. According to an

90
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,970
article from Reuters the major towns and
cities were abandoned by the population

91
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,280
as panic set in and players rushed to
evacuate to the relative safety of the

92
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,490
countryside, leaving urban areas filled
to the brim with corpses and the city

93
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,460
streets literally white with the bones of the dead.

94
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,960
This is where science got interested. The Journal of Epidemiology compared Corrupted Blood to

95
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,260
real-life SARS and avian influenza outbreaks.
Terrorism experts also studied the event.

96
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,640
They looked at the decision by
some gamers to intentionally infect

97
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,760
other players and this provided some insight
into how terrorist cells form in the real world.

98
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,400
In the end game developers
had to invoke the nuclear option and

99
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,300
reset the game service to undo the havoc
wrought by Hakkar the Soulflayer, blood

100
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,480
god of the Gurubashi trolls and, apparently,
bio terrorist. Thanks, Thought Bubble!

101
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,900
Games also make their way into
daily life through gamification.

102
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,920
This grows out of achievement systems some
video games use to reward players in

103
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,040
addition to the normal game objectives.
These systems have proven to be very motivational,

104
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,280
so why not try them out in real life?
Purdue is doing this.

105
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,700
Some schools reward students with badges
when they pass tests or complete

106
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,440
homework assignments. Gamification is
also used in fitness. For example some

107
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,110
fitness apps award badges for walking
around and even let users compete with

108
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,610
friends for the highest step count. Oh, that reminds
me, hold on. This counts as steps, right?

109
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,700
Academic studies also seem to validate time spent
gaming.  Studies from China and Australia

110
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,880
indicate that expert-level video game
players have a measurable increase in

111
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,920
cognitive functions, perception, and motor
control. These players were found to have

112
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,500
increased gray matter and increased
connectivity in their brains!

113
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,040
So next time your mom says you're playing too much video games, you go "hey mom I'm increasing my

114
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,360
gray matter." A hospital in Florida
studied their surgeons who played video

115
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,620
games before performing surgery and
found that surgeons who played video

116
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,500
games for more than three hours in a
week made 37 percent fewer errors. They were 27

117
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,170
percent faster during surgery over those
surgeons who did not. Gaming also has

118
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,230
cool applications in medicine. An Oxford
University study indicated that playing

119
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,730
Tetris can reduce the after effects of
psychological trauma and might offer relief

120
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,210
of PTSD symptoms. There's this virtual
reality game called Snow World.

121
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,380
It's played on the Oculus Rift and it's used for
pain management. Burn victims report

122
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,190
less pain during bandage removal and
reapplication while playing this game.

123
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,010
Another example is the online game
Fold It. In this game thousands of

124
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,720
players help doctors an computers fold proteins and other structures to support drug research.

125
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:21,480
In 2011 players helped scientists solve a decade old problem in under 10 days! That's the power of games!

126
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,280
So what we're saying here is that
games can be a positive force in the world.

127
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,860
And that's why we're going to spend the next twenty weeks or so playing with these ideas.

128
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,840
So press Start or set up the board or tee up the ball or whatever. Let's play! Thanks for watching.

129
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,370
We'll see you next week. Now if you
excuse me, I got some roads to crossy.

130
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:44,560
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey
Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana,

131
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,560
and it is made with the help of all
these nice people. If you'd like to keep Crash

132
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,490
Course free for everyone forever, you can support the series at Patreon, a crowdfunding platform that allows you to support
