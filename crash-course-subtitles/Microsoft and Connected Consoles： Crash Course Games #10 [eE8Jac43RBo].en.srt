00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Hi, I'm AndrÃ© Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,160
So we close out the 1990s with the Sony PlayStation leading the market

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,300
and Nintendo the only other real contender.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:14,080
And by 2001, following the commercial disaster of the Dreamcast, Sega had completely exited the console industry.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,140
But as one company stopped making consoles, a new company took its place.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,500
Microsoft was about to enter the market and gaming was about to get connected to the internet.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,260
Whew, good thing we survived Y2K for that.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:34,060
[Theme Music]

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,860
In March of 2000, Sony, who was already dominating the market, released the PlayStation 2.

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,680
The system itself was light years ahead of its predecessor.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,500
It was a 128-bit system and stored its games on DVDs and CDs.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,400
It also had backwards compatibility,  which meant that it could play the large library of existing software from the original PlayStation.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,460
A common problem in the industry is game mortality.

14
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,300
Technology evolves and players are left with a bunch of old games they can no longer play.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,520
Publishers might rewrite or port some old games to the new systems

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,200
but for the most part, people had to keep their old consoles or just live without playing their beloved copy of Nascar Thunder 94.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,740
The PlayStation 2's backward compatibility solves this problem and won a lot of consumer approval

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:21,380
by allowing players to play new PS2 games while still being able to play their old PS1 games all on the same system.

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,220
And the switch from CD-ROM to a DVD drive was also pretty important.

20
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:33,220
The maximum storage for a PlayStation game grew from 700 megabytes on CDs to as large as 8.5 gigabytes with the new format.

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,820
This allowed developers to work on longer, richer and more complex games

22
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,500
without having to stretch the game across multiple disks the way they did with Final Fantasy VII.

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,920
Since the PlayStation 2 had a DVD-ROM in it, that meant you could also play DVDs on it.

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,080
Kinda similar to how on the PlayStation 1, you could play video games or your Backstreet Boys and Spice Girls CDs.

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,560
It was the 90s.

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,620
This was the early start of seeing game consoles as more than just game consoles

27
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,260
but full multimedia entertainment devices.

28
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,240
And the PlayStation 2 offered a way to connect to the internet, but it wasn't very straightforward.

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Consumers had to purchase an adaptor and an additional memory card to go online.

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,500
The servers didn't even have a name in 2002, but it allowed for multiplayer match-ups and additional content within certain games.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,840
But, as is the way with these things, the tech was pretty cool but it was the PlayStation 2's games that helped it succeed.

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,060
Games like Grand Theft Auto III.
It was one of the first 3D open worlds.

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,160
Sure, you could follow the constructed missions, but you were also free to do whatever you wanted.

34
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,500
For example, you could just choose to steal cars and listen to the radio

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,840
which was sort of like a real radio station with a talk show and licensed albums from real musicians.

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,300
You could also run away from the cops, beat up random citizens, just do whatever.

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,160
IN THE GAME.
Don't do this stuff in real life.

38
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,460
But a game where you can do almost anything -- and I do mean ANYTHING -- did have its critics.

39
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,460
Game Spy called it the Game of the Year in 2001

40
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,180
and also awarded it the less coveted Most Offensive Game of the Year Award.

41
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,840
The ESRB gave it a mature rating for violence and sexual content

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,500
and the game was banned in Australia,
where there was no "adults only" rating.

43
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,820
But, despite the controversy, it was still the biggest selling video game in the US in 2001 and still makes titles to this day.

44
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,260
The PlayStation 2 would go on to be the best selling gaming console of all time.

45
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,560
As of March 2012, the last time Sony released its numbers, it had sold over 155 million units

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,340
and its library of games -- more than 1900 titles.

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,140
And the PlayStation 2 console was an active product that Sony supported for nearly thirteen years

48
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,040
making it one of the longest-lived consoles of all time.

49
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,980
In fact, the last server on the PlayStation 2 was shut off this year, 2016.

50
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,680
So the PlayStation 2 was a pretty big deal but it was about to get some major competition.

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,120
In January of 2001, Bill Gates and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson debuted the Xbox at the Consumer Electronics Show.

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,540
Microsoft's console, the Xbox, was the first by an American company since the sales of the Atari Jaguar stopped in 1996.

53
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:00,420
And the Xbox made all the standard technological improvements -- building a faster, higher capacity machine than the previous consoles.

54
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,580
But it was that integrated ethernet port and the network that Microsoft would launch

55
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,860
that led to some significant changes both inside and outside the console industry.

56
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,400
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,260
Microsoft had designed its Xbox with a plan to move online, which is exactly what it did on its one-year anniversary.

58
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,520
In 2002, Xbox Live launched, and more than 150,000 subscribers signed up in its first week.

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,480
The system was a unified network where players could connect and compete with other players all over the world.

60
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,820
Players could speak to each other and co-ordinate strategy with the new voice chat system.

61
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,940
The network also allowed them to download new maps and other content for their games.

62
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,940
Microsoft released its Xbox with Halo: Combat Evolved.

63
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,100
It was a critical and commercial success.

64
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,560
By 2005, the game had sold over five million copies worldwide.

65
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,900
Video game journalist Steven Curran called it "the most important launch game for any console ever"

66
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,240
and that it surpassed Goldeneye as a new standard for multiplayer combat.

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,140
But Halo launched before Xbox Live was finished and would never support online multiplayer matches.

68
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,580
But it did support a feature called System Link

69
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,200
which allowed players to connect up to four consoles together like a LAN network -- like PC users have been doing for years --

70
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,620
to have up to 16-player deathmatches.

71
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:15,240
But Halo 2 launched in 2004 and delivered on the promise of Halo's great multiplayer experience and the potential of the Xbox Live network.

72
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,100
Halo 2's system was pretty great at matching players against other gamers with similar skill levels

73
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,700
and the game was really designed for online multiplayer.

74
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,480
With this online matchmaking, players had the chance to get good -- like, REALLY good --

75
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,020
and some of these players would eventually take part in the first US professional league of Major League Gaming

76
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,200
which hosted its first televised league tournament in 2006, playing Halo 2. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

77
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,560
So professional gaming, or electronic sports (or e-sports), were on the rise all over the world

78
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,800
with the help of online multiplayer from PCs and now also from Xbox.

79
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,640
But at the same time, Microsoft was making some games for players who didn't want to pay that monthly subscription

80
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,680
or just wanted the single-player experience.

81
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,420
Like 2004's Fable.

82
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,560
Fable included a morality alignment system that encouraged players to make moral choices within the game.

83
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,040
Completely opposite from Grand Theft Auto III, player's decisions in Fable now had real consequences

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,840
and the choices to help or hurt non-player characters in the game would be reflected in the onscreen character appearance

85
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,640
and the non-player characters definitely remembered if you murdered someone in their town.

86
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,940
They were less likely to help known thieves and killers.

87
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,120
Meanwhile, Nintendo had its own entry in this Console War -- the Nintendo GameCube.

88
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,260
It debuted in 2001 and was the first Nintendo system to deliver its software on disks rather than cartridges.

89
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:36,200
But instead of using standard five-inch DVDs like Microsoft and Sony, Nintendo chose the unusual mini-DVD format.

90
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,620
Look at you, you're so tiny.

91
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,680
Now, these disks couldn't hold as much data as DVDs but they did make piracy more difficult for Nintendo games.

92
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,060
And, like Sony, the GameCube supported limited online gaming with an adaptor.

93
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,580
Nintendo's next console, the Wii, would have a few games with online multiplayer

94
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,880
but Nintendo would not fully adopt an online service like the Xbox until the Wii U console in 2012.

95
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,280
But we're just talking home consoles.

96
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,680
Nintendo also developed the DS handheld system in the early 2000s.

97
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,940
The Game Boy had been around since 1989.

98
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,040
There had been several evolutions of the handheld platform, like the Game Boy Colour, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy SP

99
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,300
but it was the DS, or Dual Screen, that was revolutionary.

100
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,640
The top screen displayed the game while the bottom was a touch screen

101
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,180
which allowed developers to include novel control schemes in their titles.

102
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,560
And it supported WiFi, continuing the trend toward connected gaming.

103
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:33,120
And Nintendo had one more major exclusive that debuted in 2001 on the GameCube -- Super Smash Brothers Melee!

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,460
The four-player free-for-all fighting game was a vast improvement to the Nintendo 64 original

105
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,240
with more Nintendo fighters and a finely tuned and balanced fighting mechanic system.

106
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,520
Melee was so well-received that it would become a standard in professional gaming

107
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,340
and these tournaments, like the FPS tournaments of Halo, were indicative of a larger shift in the industry.

108
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,160
So whether playing in groups and gaming tournaments or LAN parties or playing at home online

109
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,880
more and more gamers were being connected with and playing real players.

110
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,680
Players were getting more competitive and forming massive communities within these games

111
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,700
and we'll get into this a little bit more when we talk about MMORPGs

112
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,980
but this internet access was giving players and gamer culture a new home.

113
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,060
Thanks for watching, we'll see you next week.

114
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,240
And make sure you pay your internet bill so you can keep watching this show and playing those games.

115
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,420
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

116
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,360
and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

117
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,160
If you'd like to keep Crash Course free for everyone forever
