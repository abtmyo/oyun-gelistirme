00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Hi, I'm AndrÃ© Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,360
So we finished the last episode nearing the end of the 1980s,

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,080
and Nintendo was dominating the US and Japanese home console markets.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,760
But, with the video game business being a capitalistic enterprise and all, competition was on the rise.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,560
The 90s was the third decade of modern video games,

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,780
and, like the First Console War between Atari, Mattel, and Coleco, competition drove innovation and better games.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,940
These new competitors were filling the hole left from the crash of the 80s,

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,840
but also targeting an older and more mature audience.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,400
In the 1990s, players started seeing first person shooters, fighting games,

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,580
and lots and lots of sports games.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,860
And today we are going to focus on the entrance of one company in particular

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,820
that prompted this innovation and the war that came with it.

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,380
Sega!

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:51,560
[Theme Music]

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,940
So the Sega Corporation of Japan had entered the North American home console market in 1986 with its Sega Master System

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,340
which desperately wanted to compete with the NES but never managed to capture much market share.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,660
But before we get ahead of ourselves, I want to take a second here to talk about Sega.

18
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,760
Sega sounds like a quintessential Japanese company but, actually, it was founded in the United States.

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,700
By Americans.

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,020
The company moved to Tokyo after World War 2 in focus on operating slot machines

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,580
and coin-operated games on US military bases.

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,540
At that time, the company was called Service Games, which would eventually be shortened and combined to form Sega.

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:29,100
Sega transitioned into video games in the 1970s, and survived the whole boom and bust that we already talked about.

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,600
And by the time Sega released its Master System, the company had been acquired by a Japanese conglomerate.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,940
OK, back to the Master System.

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,380
The Sega Master System failed to really compete with the NES in the United States, even though the hardware was technically superior.

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,580
This was mostly attributed to Sega's poor marketing,

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,140
but also because of Nintendo's licencing practices (which we talked about last episode)

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,420
which limited the number of third-party developers that Sega could work with.

30
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,940
But then, in 1989, Sega released its Genesis console, which was much more competitive.

31
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,720
To paraphrase Yoda, "Big gun, the second console wars had."

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,020
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

33
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,960
Sega's first shots in the console wars were from the marketing department.

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,360
Sega ran commercials that touted their superiority with the tagline "Genesis does what Nintendon't!"

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,500
Their main weapon, though, was the technology.

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,460
Their position as the only next generation console on the market was a strong advantage

37
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,640
and they kept using that term "blast processing".

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,600
The superior Genesis hardware had moved from an 8-bit to 16-bit architecture.

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,920
This made for improvements in the look, sound, and playability of Sega's games.

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,000
This improved hardware allowed a home console to more closely match the quality of games in arcades.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,140
Sega also took a cue from Nintendo and created a flagship character that could be the face of the console like Mario was for Nintendo.

42
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,340
Sega's answer to the dumpy plumber who could sometimes throw fireballs was Sonic the Hedgehog.

43
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,880
But Sonic wasn't Sega's first attempt at a mascot.

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,340
During the Master System era, Alex Kid had been Sega's flagship character.

45
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,500
Unfortunately, he was a bland character on a system that hardly anyone owned

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,820
so no-one even cared enough about Alex Kid to hate him.

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,140
Sonic was designed to fix that problem and become the hedgehog that Sega could really sink its corporate identity teeth into.

48
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,860
Sonic, he could really move! Sonic, he's got attitude! Sonic, he's the fastest thing alive!

49
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,100
Sonic was meant to appeal to an older crowd than Mario and the NES and it kind of worked.

50
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,460
The Genesis also differentiated itself with the quality of its sports games.

51
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,380
They partnered with American athletes to make games like Joe Montana Football and Mario Lemieux Hockey

52
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,960
and licenced real teams and their players into these games.

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,640
Sega succeeded. It differentiated itself from Nintendo and was growing in market share.

54
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,700
But then, in 1991, Nintendo introduced its own 16-bit console in North America --

55
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,040
the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or Super NES. Thanks, Thought Bubble!

56
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,440
So the Super NES launched with the universally acclaimed Super Mario World

57
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,880
and the technologically impressive racing game F Zero.

58
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,720
But the Genesis software library had a two-year headstart.

59
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,060
Many games for the Genesis were already on the market

60
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,480
and the Genesis continued to lead during the Super Nintendo's first year.

61
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
But Nintendo fell back on their tried-and-true strategy of producing high-quality games.

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,380
The company created hit after massive hit for the new console.

63
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,260
Nintendo games like Super Mario Kart, Starfox, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past all sold millions of copies.

64
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,420
Third-party developers also delivered hits like Chrono Trigger, Mega Man X, the Final Fantasy series

65
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,120
and the import of the immensely popular arcade hit Street Fighter 2.

66
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,420
We'll talk more about that later.

67
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,840
And Nintendo also introduced another successful console around this time -- the Game Boy

68
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,000
which would go on to be one of the most successful handhelds of all time.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,800
Even though the Game Boy was handheld, it had similar capabilities to an 8-bit console.

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,040
It only displayed four shades of grey, though.

71
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,720
Some people even said it was green.

72
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,880
And it required a ton of AA batteries.

73
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,900
But it was portable, and it was bundled with the hit game Tetris.

74
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,820
When the Game Boy released in Japan, it sold out of its initial 300,000 run in two weeks.

75
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,940
This early success in handheld gaming would lead Nintendo to dominate this sector of the gaming industry for decades.

76
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,940
The Second Console War was long and difficult, but there were some upsides.

77
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,200
#1: Nobody died.

78
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,780
#2: All of this was pretty great for people who liked to play video games.

79
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,680
The Console War was capitalism at its best.

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,900
Competition drove rapid innovation and improvements in video game hardware and software.

81
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,700
But the Console War wasn't the only fight going on in the early 90s.

82
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,180
There was also the bitterly fought battle between M. Bison and Ryu.

83
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,460
Fighting games were huge at this time

84
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,780
and Street Fighter 2, which was released in arcades in 1991, revolutionised the format.

85
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,400
Now, fighting games had been around since the early days of video games

86
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,760
but the genre was mostly made up of platforming beat-em-up titles like Double Dragon.

87
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,520
The original Street Fighter pitted players against each other in head-to-head combat.

88
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,660
It had a moderate success in Japan and America.

89
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,060
Street fighter 2, though? That was a game changer.

90
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,760
There were character backstories, you got to know all their blood types.

91
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,500
Hey, you may want to donate blood to Guile one day. You don't know.

92
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,260
But the real star of the show was the gameplay.

93
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,900
The new 16-bit technology and its advanced controls were hyperresponsive

94
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,060
and gave players the ability to execute a huge number of moves.

95
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,060
Street Fighter 2 invented the combo mechanic

96
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,720
and created the deep human pleasure of a well-timed Shoryuken or a Haryuken

97
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,920
or whatever that thing that E. Honda does when he just does this.

98
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,180
But nothing breeds competition like success

99
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,540
so in 1992, Midway released Mortal Kombat to compete with Street Fighter 2.

100
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,160
Its deeply compelling characters, visual style and carnage made it a popular alternative to the Street Fighter series.

101
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,380
Mortal Kombat used digitised photographs as models for the characters.

102
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,900
It was supposed to make the fighters look more real  than characters in Street Fighter.

103
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,300
Mortal Kombat also aimed for the adult market by including a lot of blood and gore.

104
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,480
And I mean a LOT.

105
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,120
You might not have known Johnny Cage's blood type, but in Mortal Kombat he could punch a dude's head off

106
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,580
and then put on his sunglasses and look super cool.

107
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,400
Hey, it could be worse. You could go up against Sub Zero and he could pull your spine out.

108
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,480
Fatality.

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,500
Excellent.

110
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,120
Let's play some Mortal Kombat!

111
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,180
Level up!

112
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,900
So when the game came out on Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, it was interesting

113
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,160
because on the Super Nintendo version, they didn't have any blood at all.

114
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,180
They actually made the blood splats clear so it looked like sweat.

115
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,220
So you weren't supposed to think that they were bleeding, you were thinking that they were just sweating.

116
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,780
And the Genesis version, as we're seeing right now, is clean to start

117
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:53,980
but you could put in a special code and if you put in that special code, you got blood.

118
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,220
I think we're gonna do that right now.

119
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,540
OK, here you go.

120
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,520
On this screen, you go A - B - A - C - A - B - B.

121
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,400
*gasp* Did you see it?

122
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,060
See it change color?

123
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,760
That means we got blood!

124
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,300
So all the game's graphic violence, the blood, the fatalities -- that's what led a lot of parents

125
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,960
and legislators to be upset specifically about Mortal Kombat.

126
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,260
It was games like this that led to the Electronic Software Ratings Board, or ESRB.

127
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:31,920
Ooh, see? That's wh-- see? That-- [laughs] That right there is why we now have ratings on our video games.

128
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,000
See? And that's why I could only play the Super Nintendo version of Mortal Kombat in my home

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,140
and why some of my friends got the Genesis version.

130
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,800
And let's talk about the ESRB for a second.

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,500
The ESRB, much like the MPAA, is a self-regulating organisation

132
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,640
that assigns age and content ratings to computer and video games.

133
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,180
And, just like the MPAA, it has become the standard of the industry.

134
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,200
Now, we're not here to talk about if this is a good thing or a bad thing

135
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,040
but rather the fact that in 1994, it was even a thing.

136
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,700
The ESRB's need for a rating scale showed that games were not only containing more mature content

137
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,280
but that they were also gaining a much wider audience.

138
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,660
People who weren't playing video games even knew about video games and what were in them.

139
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,520
Like movies, comic books, and music before it, games were going mainstream, and people noticed.

140
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,600
Speaking of more mature games, Doom was released on the PC in 1993.

141
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,040
Once again, players and non-players reacted very differently.

142
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,840
The game's violence and "evil" imagery caused a media uproar.

143
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,760
For example, on CBS' Sixty Minutes, a former army colonel called the game "a mass murder simulator"

144
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,200
and tried to connect the game directly to the 1999 school shootings in Columbine, Colorado.

145
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,100
So Doom was controversial but no-one disputes that it was also hugely influential in the world of video game design.

146
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,680
It was a major improvement on the first-person shooter

147
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,480
and its wide popularity brought a lot of gamers to the genre.

148
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,340
The game was praised for its level design and its overall gameplay

149
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,200
but it innovated in a number of important ways.

150
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,960
Doom was an early example of the use of 3D elements in video games.

151
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,560
Sure, some people say the game wasn't purely 3D and had some 2D elements

152
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,720
but the experience of running through 3D rendered hallways was new and deeply appealing to players.

153
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,340
Doom was also one of the first games to successfully make use of network play.

154
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,260
Players could compete over the internet.

155
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,700
The extremely popular online arena matches were called deathmatches,

156
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,900
now a standard term in the online FPS world.

157
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,680
The other big innovation in Doom was the modification system.

158
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,160
Players could edit or "mod" the levels that came with the game, or they could create levels from scratch.

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,940
This was a very popular feature and it shaped the video game industry for years to come.

160
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,780
Many game designers had their first taste of creating games while making levels for Doom.

161
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:36,560
Wow, game modification, online play, fighting games, 16-bit consoles, portable systems, super fast hedgeheogs!

162
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,120
The 90s saw a number of huge leaps forward for the video game industry

163
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,760
and we've only talked about the first half of the decade!

164
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,220
Next week, we'll see the entry of a major new player to the console market, the adoption of CD-ROM technology

165
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,260
and the rapid evolution of 3D gaming that would play out on the next generation of consoles.

166
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,800
And there's another war.

167
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,960
Another Console War.

168
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,180
Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.

169
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,360
Say bye, Sonic!

171
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,700
Sega!

172
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,080

173
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,460
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

174
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,320
and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

175
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,460
If you'd like to keep Crash Course free for everyone forever
