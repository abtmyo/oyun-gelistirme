00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Hi, I'm AndrÃ© Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,820
Today we're going to be looking at one of the biggest genres of games.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,420
The games many players associate with family and friends, games that have been making a comeback in recent years.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,260
We're talking about board games.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:18,680
Now, there are tons of board games out there, but we're going to take a slightly different approach today and look really closely at just two board games that define their eras.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,140
The family classic, Monopoly, and the game that brought Euro Games to the US, Settlers of Catan.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,980
And we'll try to touch on how their history and reception have helped define the genre.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:36,140
[Theme Music]

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,980
Life, Risk, Clue, Sorry!, Hi-Ho Cherry-O

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,300
These are some of the many games that have been the cornerstones of the family game night for decades.

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:52,220
Though board games have existed for thousands of years, these games have seen unprecedented popularity within the last hundred or so, and now have countless variations.

12
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,980
Many of these games, though not all, could be called American-style games.

13
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,420
Loosely, these games are defined as having pretty long playtime, involving luck, and often staging conflict between players.

14
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,160
And arguably, the most popular American board game has all these qualities -- Monopoly.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:14,440
In 2015, Hasbro's Vice President of Game Marketing, Jonathan Berkowitz, stated that "over a billion people have played Monopoly around the world."

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,180
Monopoly is played in 114 countries and has been translated into 47 different languages.

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,200
It's a global game.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,180
So why is Monopoly so successful?

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,160
It could be due to its easy-to-learn game mechanics, customisable gameplay, and broad audience appeal.

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:34,360
Hasbro itself claims that one of the reasons Monopoly has endured for generations is that it offers a classic gameplay that appeals to kids, parents, and grandparents alike.

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,620
But according to the Monopolist author Mary Pilon,

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,300
Monopoly's success probably stems from the fact that it has an element of roleplay which provides people

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,020
"a context to do things that we can't typically do in real life."

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:51,860
In Monopoly, that means playing the role of the rich entrepreneur, owning lots of property and making lots of money fast.

25
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,840
But Monopoly isn't without scandal.

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,120
A game about making money fast and owning real estate having a scandal?

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
What a shock!

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,220
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,180
Charles Darrow claimed to have invented Monopoly in 1933 while unemployed during the Great Depression.

30
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,980
Allegedly, he developed the gameplay on an old oil cloth to entertain his family and friends.

31
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,360
He became incredibly rich when he sold his idea to the game company Parker Brothers.

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,480
It was a classic rags-to-riches story, but that's not really Monopoly's true origin.

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,300
The game was actually conceived by Elizabeth "Lizzie" Magie in 1903.

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,960
Lizzie was an artist, inventor, and feminist that opposed the business practices of some of the biggest industry titans of the time, like Andrew Carnegie and John D Rockefeller.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,340
To voice her opposition to the injustices of capitalism, she invented and received a patent for a game called The Landlords Game.

36
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,200
It allowed players to play one of two roles -- as the monopolist, attempting to acquire as much wealth as possible while destroying opponents,

37
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,840
or as the anti-monopolist, acquiring wealth fairly to win.

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,520
Lizzie hoped that people would play as the anti-monopolist and start opposing the business practices of the time.

39
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,220
And The Landlords Game was sold for a short time and became popular enough that it was shared and expanded upon by other players.

40
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,380
An altered version of The Landlords Game by the Quakers was the game that Charles Darrow copied and sold to Parker Brothers as Monopoly in 1935.

41
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,600
Lizzie eventually got some compensation for her contributions to the game when Parker Brothers

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,820
purchased her patent so they could enforce it against other game publishers who released similar games.

43
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:17,120
Lizzie's game would reach a huge audience, but now it doesn't deliver the anti-capitalist message she intended.

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,360
Thanks, Thought Bubble! So, scandal notwithstanding, Monopoly also has its critics.

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,280
Users of the gaming community Board Game Geek rate Monopoly among its 20 Worst Games.

46
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,600
That's out of 10,000 games!

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,320
And FiveThirtyEight writer Oliver Roeder mined his community's reviews and found some consistent frustrations within its gaming mechanics.

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,240
Such as the fact that players can be eliminated quickly, making it pretty difficult to have fun when they can't participate.

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,920
Monopoly also frequently suffers from a runaway leader problem where a player's early luck quickly compounds into an insurmountable lead.

50
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,100
The average playtime around three hours, much of which is spent waiting on other players, probably doesn't help either.

51
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,460
Many of these criticisms stem from the American-style genre Monopoly helped define.

52
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,500
But players' options would expand with the introduction of Euro Games in the United States.

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,800
Euro Games are different from traditional American-style board games in a number of ways.

54
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:11,320
They generally have shorter playtimes, indirect player interaction, usually revolve around economic themes, and emphasise strategy over luck and conflict.

55
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,640
Sometimes these games are called German-style games, as many of them are produced in Germany,

56
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,540
which just so happens to publish more board games than any other country per capita.

57
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,800
In 1995, The Settlers of Catan paved the way for the genre in the United States and outside Europe.

58
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,900
It wasn't the first German game outside of Germany, but it was the first to see this kind of success.

59
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,640
Settlers of Catan was created by legendary German game designer, and four-time German Game of the Year Winner, Klaus Teuber.

60
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,460
Players act as settlers on the island of Catan, hence the game's name.

61
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:46,840
Players try to build settlements, manage the resources of wool, grain, ore, brick, and lumber, avoid the robber, and try to obtain 10 victory points to win the game.

62
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,280
And each game is different, since the board is made of multiple adjustable tiles that are placed randomly on the main board at the beginning of the game.

63
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,980
Writer and game designer Richard Dansky says that Catan is "a resource-management game, defined by position and strategising..."

64
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,080
"A social game defined by horse trading of resource cards..."

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,960
"A game of chance, ruled by dice rolls and card draw..."

66
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,800
"A hardcore game and a light social pastime and everything in between."

67
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,020
Settler of Catan has sold over 22 million copies and has been translated into 30 languages.

68
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,940
The Washington Post called Catan "the board game of our time", while Wired Magazine called it "the Monopoly Killer".

69
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,340
It's become one of the most popular board games of all time, rivaling both Risk and Monopoly.

70
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,740
Settlers of Catan has even gone on to spawn the Catan Championships.

71
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,480
In 2015, at the SPIEL in Essen, Germany, 1,040 people played it simultaneously, setting a world record.

72
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,980
It's part of a new and growing wave of analogue board games that are continuing to take hold of the public.

73
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,620
And board games aren't just a big deal within their genres.

74
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,700
For example, ICV2 states that sales of hobby games were up 20% from 2013 and were double those from 2008.

75
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:58,340
The site also claims that American and Canadian citizens spent nearly $700 million on analogue hobby games of which $75 million were board game sales.

76
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:04,560
2015 data suggests that these overall hobby game sales are up nearly 26% since 2013.

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,700
Now, these numbers pale in comparison to video games, but they definitely demonstrate an upward trend of tabletop and board game sales.

78
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,660
And with Kickstarter, an increased number of games are being made and supported by the gaming community.

79
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:21,240
As of May 2016, there are 227 tabletop game projects on Kickstarter, with about a third of them being fully funded.

80
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,340
So it seems like many people are buying games, and the way people gather around these games is changing too.

81
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,380
With the introduction of the internet, more and more people are finding others like themselves to play these board games.

82
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:40,580
In Germany, the city of Essen annually holds one of the largest tabletop and board gaming festivals in the world, known as the Internationale Spieltage (a.k.a the SPIEL).

83
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:46,180
Last year, they had around 160,000 attendees and 900 exhibitors just for tabletop and board games.

84
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,840
And people like to do more than just play board games and attend game-related events.

85
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,180
They're interested in watching other people play board games too.

86
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,580
On TableTop, a popular YouTube series, a different board game is reviewed each episode as its being played.

87
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:04,120
The hosts have reviewed everything from Pandemic, where players play as medics eradicating several highly-infectious diseases from the world,

88
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,040
to Eldritch Horror, where players combat Lovecraftian monsters while exploring the Earth.

89
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,580
I was on an episode of TableTop once.

90
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,180
#humblebrag

91
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:20,580
Tabletop gaming has become such a popular part of social life that board game cafes have popped up around the world, and can be found in London, New York.

92
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,580
There's one in Toronto that's aptly named Snakes & Lattes.

93
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,040
But Shanghai, China, is currently the one in the lead with an estimated 1,000 board game cafes.

94
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,120
So as you can see, board games are an important genre of gaming.

95
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:39,400
Classic family games have infiltrated many people's lives and the introduction and proliferation of Euro Games suggests they will have an ever-increasing role.

96
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,940
And we haven't even talked about the most popular board game in the world, but we'll get to that next week when we talk about gaming's role in education.

97
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,960
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.

98
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,040
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana
