00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Hello and welcome to Crash Course Games. I'm John Green.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,500
André is out at a Comic-Con this week so I'm gonna be your substitute teacher.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,060
I know what you're thinking.
I also wish André was here.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,380
So today we're gonna do our best to tackle a huge topic.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,360
You might guess it from the word "tackle".

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,440
I'm talking about sports, a multi-billion dollar industry.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,800
Now, of course, we can't get to all of it.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,220
There are just so many facets of sports, from AFC Wimbledon to Liverpool Football Club to, presumably, other things.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,400
Brandon just pointed out to me that there is also, for instance, the Olympics, which start today!

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,340
So we're gonna get into the history of that event and lots of others.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,120
It's all a bit daunting, but if Serena Williams can win 22 Grand Slam titles, 4 Olympic gold medals,

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,540
and find time to star in a Beyonce video, then I guess I can probably survive sitting in this chair and talking about sports for a while.

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:53,620
[Theme Music]

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,820
Sports seem to have been around for at least as long as civilisation has.

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,620
Like, in Mongolia, there's a cave painting from around 7000 BCE that depicts a wrestling match surrounded by crowds.

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:10,600
And in a cave in Egypt, there are paintings on rocks from at least 6,000 years ago that seem to depict humans swimming and doing archery.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:18,300
Now, of course, with swimming and archery and wrestling, it's hard to know if these were sports exactly, because these were also things that people did, you know, to survive.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:25,960
Wrestling might just have been a relatively non-lethal form of combat, which goodness knows early humans needed, given their astonishingly high homicide rates.

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,640
But then again, from swimming to running, we're still making sports out of everyday activities.

20
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,980
In Ancient Sumer, around 2100 BCE, the Epic of Gilgamesh gave us one of the first written accounts of sports actually being played.

21
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,840
The sport was belt wrestling.

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:48,080
And around the same time in Egypt, monuments to pharaohs indicate that a number of sports were being played, including wrestling, weightlifting, long jumping, swimming, rowing, and fishing.

23
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:55,540
And that brings us to Ancient Greece and the Olympics, which were first held in 776 BCE on the planes of Olympia.

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:02,320
These proto-games are believed to have been festivals that the city states Elis and Pisa held together as part of a peace-inducing agreement.

25
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:10,240
And a part of that agreement described the Olympiad, or the four-year time period between the Games which still dictates, you know, when we play them today.

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:20,720
Historical retellings of the first official Games state that the only event that actually took place onsite was a 200 yard dash, but in later events more racing was added, followed by wrestling events.

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,560
And it's believed that part of the appeal of the early Olympics was that it encouraged men to get in shape so they could be better soldiers.

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,880
Like, running in particular was very valuable.

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,800
By 708 BCE, what came to be known as the Pentathlon was added.

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,100
This consisted of throwing discuses and javelins, wrestling, leaping, and, of course, running -- all good skills for a soldier.

31
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:48,240
Winners of events were given wreath crowns made out of the branches and leaves from a sacred olive tree and this tree was said to grow behind the local temple of Zeus.

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,380
It had been planted there, supposedly, by Hercules himself.

33
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,440
Hercules was also seen as the founder of the original festivals that became the Games.

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,580
But the Eleans, from the city of Elis, also believed that the Olympic Games were founded by their king, Iphitos,

35
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,340
and that he had been guided to plant an olive tree that the Delphi oracle told him to plant in the same place.

36
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,280
So a little bit confusing, but then, you know, so is most of Greek mythology.

37
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,200
Of more concern to us, the Games were almost never interrupted.

38
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,580
They survived during the Persian Wars of 480 BCE.

39
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,720
And even though they weren't officially called the Olympics during the time the Arcadians captured the site, they were still held.

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:31,420
The Games only halted when, in 393 CE, the Christian Byzantine Emperor Theodosius I declared them a pagan sport and banned them.

41
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,640
The Olympics then took about, you know, 1,500 years off before being reinstated by Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France.

42
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,880
This happened at an interesting time in world history.

43
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,060
Like, Coubertin was committed to the idea of health through physical education.

44
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,760
He saw the Olympics as a dynamic way to inspire youth to be healthy, but it also created national pride.

45
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,820
And the end of the 19th century was also a time when Europe, especially, was focused on nation-building.

46
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,500
So two years after he initially proposed the idea, he was given permission by the French Union de Sports Athlétiques to run them.

47
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,380
And the first modern Olympic Games were held on Sunday March 24th 1896 in Athens, Greece.

48
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,300
But the Olympics didn't achieve mainstream popularity until around 1924.

49
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,240
The '24 Games, held in Paris, had about 3,000 athletes from 44 different countries.

50
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:24,100
For perspective, at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, there were about 10,700 athletes from about 204 nations.

51
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:32,080
So there are lots of reasons people participate in the Olympics and watch them, but I wanna focus on national pride because it was important to Coubertin and it's still important to us today.

52
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,980
In 2011, the BBC Global Poll surveyed over 21,000 people from 21 different countries about the Games,

53
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:45,720
and in 18 of those countries, the majority of people surveyed claimed that their team's performance at the Olympics affected their national pride.

54
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,760
And it's important to many athletes as well.

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,280
Like, in 2012, 5000-metre runner Lopez Lomong wrote an off-ed in the New York Times on this topic.

56
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:03,340
Lomong is from South Sudan and he lived in Kenya as a refugee for 10 years and then moved to the U.S. when he was 16-years-old and eventually, he started competing for the U.S. Olympic Team.

57
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,540
In his essay, he wrote, "The Olympics is the ultimate show of national pride and identity."

58
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:15,500
"For me, competing in the Olympic Games has been an opportunity to thank a country that opened its arms to me 11 years ago, showing me that I mattered."

59
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,260
In the end, nations are constructs.

60
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,040
That doesn't mean they aren't real, but it does mean that they were invented by people.

61
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,680
And the Olympics is one way among many that we acknowledge and affirm our nation, but also acknowledge and affirm other nations.

62
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:35,400
If you've ever watched our Crash Course World History episode on nationalism, you'll already know that "national pride" is a loaded phrase and that nationhood is a messy business.

63
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:42,200
Like, as Bloom famously said in Ulysses, "A nation is the same people living in the same place... or also living in different places."

64
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,580
And the Olympics is one of the ways we try to firm up what we mean when we talk about our country, but also other countries.

65
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,680
But, of course, the Olympics are also about something else.

66
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,880
They're about selling a lot of Coca-Cola and Visa cards.

67
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:02,500
If commerce makes the contemporary world go 'round, it also makes the contemporary sports world go 'round, so let's talk about the biggest business sport of them all -- soccer.

68
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,680
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

69
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,760
Soccer, otherwise known as football or futball, is the largest and most popular sport worldwide.

70
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:17,300
The Federation Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, reports that over 240 million players exist across the planet in over 200 countries.

71
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,420
The earliest evidence of a game like soccer comes from around 2,000 years ago during the Han Dynasty in China.

72
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:31,100
People played with small leather balls and kicked them into nets and the Greeks and Romans played a similar game, but they never considered it to be an official sporting event.

73
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Soccer persevered into the Middle Ages but was eventually banned by King Edward III in 1365 BCE and by that time it had become pretty violent, with players frequently punching and biting one another.

74
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,800
You know, as opposed to the contemporary game where players almost never bite each other.

75
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,760
Also soldiers became so engrossed in football that they missed drills in practices.

76
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,800
It would be banned again in 1424 by King James I of Scotland due to similar troubles.

77
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:04,400
But soccer wove itself in and out of culture over the years until 1815, when a decisive set of laws governing the sport known as the Cambridge Rules came into being.

78
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,720
The rules divided people.

79
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:13,080
Some stuck with the set rules and played soccer as we know it today, while others preferred a more physical contact version which came to be known as rugby.

80
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:22,220
In 1863, 11 clubs and schools from London set up basic rules to govern all aspects of soccer, and that's considered the official origin of modern football.

81
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:32,480
And then, in 1904, FIFA was formed and then, just 89 short years later, in 1993, the FIFA video games were invented and changed my life forever.

82
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,000
But anyway, thanks, Thought Bubble.

83
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,740
So soccer has proved to be a cultural link for many nations.

84
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:44,220
Like, during the World War I 1914 Christmas truce, both the German and British troops put aside their weapons and played a friendly soccer match.

85
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,140
Even Mahatma Gandhi regularly attended football matches.

86
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:56,460
In fact, when he lived in South Africa, he created soccer clubs in cities such as Pretoria, Durban, and Johannesburg before he traveled to India to lead the fight for independence.

87
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:03,040
Each of those clubs was named the Passive Resisters Soccer Club, and, by the way, women's soccer isn't anything new either.

88
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,840
According to an 1869 issue of Harper's Bazaar, women were encouraged to take part in kickabouts and pick up games.

89
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,680
Between 1881 and 1897, we have records of over 120 organised women's soccer matches.

90
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:25,520
But women's soccer didn't debut in the Olympics until 1996, when the U.S. women's soccer team won the gold medal that year in front of record-breaking crowds of over 76,000 people.

91
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,600
All in all, soccer has been called "the world's game" for a reason.

92
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,920
No other sport is as widely recognised.

93
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,160
There are more than 3.5 billion soccer fans.

94
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,220
To put that in perspective, that's over eight times the fanbase of American football.

95
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:45,060
And speaking of fanbases, fans can be enthusiastic for lots of different reasons beside the national pride we talked about earlier.

96
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,940
Like, there have been lots of research papers on why we love watching sports so much.

97
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,980
They give us a sense of community, they boost self-esteem, they make us happy, and so on.

98
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,660
Of course, they also make us miserable.

99
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,660
But it turns out some of the reasons might be purely physiological.

100
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:06,180
Like, according to a 1998 study, male sports fans actually experience an increase in testosterone when their team wins.

101
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,940
They also experience a decrease after a loss, so loving Liverpool is literally bad for my health.

102
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:19,880
In another study, passionate University of Florida football fans, both men and women, were monitored while observing three different types of pictures:

103
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,420
animal attacks, erotic scenarios, and Gators in game-winning situations.

104
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,440
That is, you know, the team, the Gators, not actual physical alligators.

105
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:37,000
In each of those three situations, the fans had high physiological arousal, as evidenced by their heart rates, brain waves, and perspiration.

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,320
And some experts believe that the brains of spectators actually go through very similar things as the brains of players.

107
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,600
Like, one study showed that the same neurons fire when you're watching someone take a free throw as when you actually take a free throw.

108
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,380
But, of course, there's also a wonderful community aspect to fandom.

109
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,960
You find people who can share with you in your joy and sorrow.

110
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:02,200
Experiences that are usually socially unacceptable, like hugging strangers or weeping in public, are suddenly okay.

111
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,400
And, at their best, sports also unite nations,
and bring players and fans together,

112
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,620
and teach us not just how to win well, but also how to lose well and how to empathise with the experiences of our opponents,

113
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,000
whether it's in the Olympics or the World Cup or Little League Baseball.

114
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,940
André has talked a lot in this series about communities that form around card games like Pokemon, or board games like Settlers of Catan, or video games like Halo.

115
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:33,540
I guess the big difference between Halo fans and Liverpool fans is that, like, Halo fans are playing Halo whereas most Liverpool fans never actually play for Liverpool Football Club.

116
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,880
But I'd argue that sports fans are a part of the game.

117
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,040
They make themselves part of the game by singing and chanting and cheering.

118
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,580
And they're the ones who collectively decide and continue the culture and traditions of a sports team.

119
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:52,820
And sports are also important because so often they service as a microcosm to the failures and successes of the social order in which they are played.

120
00:10:52,820 --> 00:11:00,100
I think we like sports, and games in general, because they aren't like life, because they aren't as random and arbitrary as life often feels.

121
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:08,960
And plus, just like wrestlers tens of thousands of years ago, when sports work, they give us this non-lethal way of having arguments, of creating tribes,

122
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,560
of getting mad at each other, of feeling the joy of winning and losing without having lethal violence.

123
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,860
That's my half-hearted defence of my all-encompassing love of football.

124
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,740
At least I'm not killing anyone!

125
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,160
Thanks for watching.
You'll see André next week.

126
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:29,640
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana, and it's made with the help of all these nice people.
