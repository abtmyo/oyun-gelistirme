00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Hi! I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:08,340
Today we are going to be talking about input devices and how they have a role in the complexity, sensitivity, and interactivity in games.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,970
In other words: we’re going to talk about
why controllers matter.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:17,770
So, an input device is really just any hardware device that can be plugged into a computer, providing data and control signals to the computer.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,170
Basically, input devices are how people talk
to the computer and tell it what to do.

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,220
And a big part of gaming relies on the type of control the player has over actions within a game.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,540
The player’s intentions should be able to translate directly into the input device and the computer should be able to provide feedback from that input just as quickly.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:41,940
And it's that constant feedback loop from your brain, to your fingertips, to the input device, to the computer, to the action taking place on the screen, that is the foundation of gameplay.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:50,900

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,700
So, each input device has its own qualities that
make it better for certain functions than others.

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,760
And the specific type of input device and
how it's used can greatly impact gameplay.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,680
Even just the feel of a controller – its weight, shape, and button configuration – can have a big impact on the gaming experience.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,520
For example, one study compared the use of a bongo drum vs. a standard controller in Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat on the GameCube.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,900
Both devices were designed for this type of gameplay and researchers found that the specific device used didn’t actually affect the performance of the player.

15
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,840
However, they did find that players were more
engaged when using the bongos versus the controller.

16
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,350
The bongos helped players feel as though they
were part of the game, playing a real instrument,

17
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,259
while the controller still felt like an intermediary
between the player and the game.

18
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:37,780
This may shed some light on the success of gaming peripherals like those plastic guitars in Rock Band and Guitar Hero, but it also hits at the heart of controller design.

19
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,700
Controllers must meet the needs of the game, but they also need to facilitate a positive gaming experience for the player.

20
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:50,399
And game controllers have come a long way since the early consoles, so let’s start by breaking controller design into five eras of gaming:

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,620
The Classic Era, the D-Pad Era, the Analog Era, the Motion Tracking Era, and the Modern Era.

22
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:01,920
Let’s start with the Classic Era and one of the earliest arcade video games – Atari’s Pong released in 1972.

23
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,080
Pong had controllers that used a round wheel that could be turned to move a player’s paddle up or down the screen.

24
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,520
These controllers would become known as paddles
for the object they were controlling.

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:17,560
But paddle controllers could only move objects in 1 dimension, which was great for games like Pong and Breakout but wouldn’t work so great for a game like Pac-Man.

26
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,300
Until the early 1980s, there still really
wasn’t a standard for game controllers.

27
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,100
It was a period of trial and error to see what would work – the Atari 2600 alone had at least a dozen different controller designs in its lifetime.

28
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,620
One of the most well-known input devices of
this time was Atari’s joystick.

29
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,020
The joystick could move in four directions, featured one button, and was simple enough that players could easily learn how to use it.

30
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,200
But the joystick was also bulky and cumbersome.

31
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,240
And in order to perform more advanced actions, the player would have to juggle both the joystick and paddle controller at the same time.

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,120
So, as game designers pushed forward towards more advanced ideas for games, the limitations of these devices were soon realized.

33
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,380
In order to create games where players could move, jump, and attack all at the same time, a new input device would have to be created.

34
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:05,020
The D-Pad era was a step towards an advanced 2D input device allowing for better gaming on the part of the game design and the player.

35
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:11,640
The D-Pad was the brainchild of Gunpei Yokoi, who created it for the 1982 Game and Watch version of Nintendo’s Donkey Kong.

36
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,750
Now, the original Game and Watch used just
two switches that moved either left or right.

37
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,160
But in order to move to more complex gameplay, they needed a way to move characters in four directions – not just two.

38
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,820
Because the game unit was so small, the standard joystick couldn’t be used and so Yokoi decided to add two more switches.

39
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,800
Unfortunately, this made gameplay feel awkward
for players.

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,080
It was difficult to remember which switch
controlled which specific action.

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:40,120
The solution was to connect these switches in a “cross-shaped, thumb-operated, micro – switched lever capable of moving in four directions.”

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,060
And thus, the D-Pad was born and would reign
supreme.

43
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,640
And the D-Pad era really was dominated by Nintendo with the basic design and configuration of the NES and Super NES controllers.

44
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,540
These were used as inspiration for the majority
of controllers to come.

45
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:59,360
In addition to the D-Pad, the NES controller featured multiple buttons, which meant that games could now be designed so that players could perform separate actions,

46
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
like, jumping and attacking an enemy at the
same time.

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:09,840
And the Super NES included shoulder buttons that allowed for even more complexity in game design, such as simultaneous input like aiming and firing in Super Metroid.

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,540
Moving forward, game creators again started looking to improve and challenge game design, this time moving into 3D.

49
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,880
But to do this, they would need a controller
that could handle that extra dimension.

50
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,100
Enter analog joysticks.

51
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,440
So, let’s start by talking about the Nintendo
64 controller.

52
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,000
I know some of you hate it because it’s big and bulky or because Mario Party gave you blisters, but it’s still an important part of this era.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,300
Now we’ve talked about this before in our episode on immersive games, but the N64 controller was created specifically to handle the 3D worlds of games like Super Mario 64.

54
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,340
It featured a D-Pad and shoulder buttons,
but more importantly it featured a thumb-stick.

55
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:51,640
Now, the thumb-stick for this controller is often referred to as an analog stick, but, as we mentioned in an earlier episode, it wasn’t technically analog – it just had the attributes of an analog stick.

56
00:04:51,640 --> 00:05:00,120
Either way, the change allowed for varying levels of input, more precise movements, and nearly 360 degrees of control which was crucial for navigating the 3D worlds.

57
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,200
The N64 controller also introduced the Rumble
Pak.

58
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,840
This addition allowed players to engage three
senses.

59
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,600
They could now see, hear, and feel feedback from the game, making the controller and player feel more a part of the game.

60
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,200
But of course, the complexity of 3D games
increased.

61
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,940
Players needed to be able to precisely move around and look around the 3D environments in their games.

62
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:27,940
Enter: PlayStation’s Dual Analog controller, which featured two true analog sticks that allowed players to control movement and the camera with their thumbs for a more accurate and precise experience.

63
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:36,240
The release of the dual analog controller gained interest from several game developers including the people behind Ape Escape – the first game to require use of both analog sticks.

64
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,920
We now move forward to the Motion Tracking Era, which made way for motion sensitive input devices.

65
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,860
These devices tried to take games to a more immersive level by extending them to the physical world.

66
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,680
So, think devices like the Wii Remote, Xbox
Kinect, and Playstation Move.

67
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,980
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

68
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,900
Once again, Nintendo made a huge impact on the industry during this era with its Wii controller.

69
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,200
This controller used an accelerometer and an optical sensor to track the remote’s motion.

70
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:08,900
So, instead of having to press a button to make an action happen, the controller took advantage of our natural movements, allowing the player to move their character through their own physical body movement.

71
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,640
And the ease of use for the Wiimote made this
device successful in a whole new demographic.

72
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:20,740
The controller was able to bridge the gap between more complex dual analog controllers and an older population that couldn’t manage the large learning curve.

73
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:29,480
For example, with the Wii, players could pick up the controller and perform a movement that they already know how to do, such as swinging the controller just like a tennis racket to hit the virtual tennis ball.

74
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,099
Quite an evolution from the early days of
Pong.

75
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,080
A few years after the Wii, Playstation made their move towards motion tracking with well, the Move.

76
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,060
Unfortunately, the Move didn’t really come up with anything revolutionary, instead effectively iterating on the Wii controller.

77
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,200
But it does show how the industry was starting to shift towards this more interactive style of gaming.

78
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,080
And then there’s the Xbox Kinect, which tried to capitalize on what the Wii was achieving with motion tracking.

79
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Unlike the Wii, the Kinect allowed the player to use their body as the controller by tracking the player’s movements through an RGB camera, and range sensors, and even tracking their voice through a microphone.

80
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,920
And though it seemed it would have been a big step forward for immersive play, the Kinect didn’t quite hit the mark.

81
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,260
As journalist Paul Tassi of Forbes
pointed out,

82
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:12,900
“The Kinect was impressive in tech demos, but in actual living rooms, consumers quickly found the actual functionality of the device was limited,

83
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,700
and rarely worth the purchase outside of a few voice commands (when they worked) and a few sporadic dance or sports titles.”

84
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,440
But hey – Dance Central was fun.

85
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,919
Thanks Thought Bubble!
So this brings us to the Modern Era.

86
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,779
Kinect sales are slumping and it is no longer
required with the purchase of an Xbox One.

87
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,240
The Playstation Move hasn't been updated since
2010.

88
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,480
And Nintendo’s latest console, the Wii U, has been a commercial flop reaching only 10% of the sales of the original Wii.

89
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,370
It seems like the era of motion tracking controls
are over.

90
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,130
Well, except in the VR space – we talked
about that in the VR episode.

91
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,140
So Playstation Move, you might have a comeback!

92
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,140
We’ll see.

93
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,740
But that doesn’t mean control design innovation
has stopped.

94
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:56,860
Microsoft’s head of Xbox accessories Zulfi Alam has touted that hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on some 40 improvements between the Xbox 360 controller and the Xbox One controller.

95
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:07,500
Now, they may not look that different, but purportedly researchers tested the controller with hundreds of gamers to improve functions such as controller contour and weight, latency between the controller and console, and even the clickiness of the d-pad.

96
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,520
And Sony’s Mark Cerny told IGN that when creating their DualShock 4 controller for the PlayStation 4,

97
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:22,680
they actively sent prototypes to major First Person Shooter developers to help better inform everything from trigger pressure and trigger location to angle of the controller to optimize the experience for FPS players.

98
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:32,080
So the world of game controllers seems to be continually iterating with a focus on player experience, but one of the biggest gaming platforms at the moment has seen little progress: mobile gaming.

99
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,720
Mobile games, which are primarily played on smartphones and tablets, don’t have any sort of tactile feedback.

100
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,460
And the industry has tried to respond.

101
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:44,960
There is basically an entire sector of smartphone peripherals to make our devices feel more like a handheld with a d-pad and clicky buttons and everything.

102
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,360
And many phone manufacturers have turned to haptic feedback in the form of short vibrations to give the player some sense that a button has been pressed.

103
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,980
But most notably, it seems like developers are designing games that effectively use the screen and get around this problem.

104
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,480
Take Angry Birds for example.

105
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,779
Angry Birds uses a control scheme that doesn’t
doesn’t require tactility to play.

106
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:08,619
The slingshot mechanism in that game doesn’t require timing, but instead only aim which you can see and are given feedback directly on the screen.

107
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:15,400
And games that do require more precise timing, like Fruit Ninja, again don’t require clicks but instead swipes on the screen, which can be seen by the player.

108
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,800
So input devices have come a long way becoming
increasingly complex and interactive.

109
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,820
And with new devices such as the Quadstick – a hands-free input device designed specifically for quadriplegics – more players than ever are able to play games.

110
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,199
And who knows what’s next.

111
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:32,240
I mean there are even games out there right
now that are powered by brain activity.

112
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,220
That’s right: mind control.

113
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,040
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next
week.

114
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,660
I’m going to go play Qbert.
On the arcade.

115
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,860
Because that diagonal stick, that’s the
only way to play that.

116
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,940
You can’t D-pad or analog that.

117
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:49,900
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianpolis, Indiana, and it's made with the help of all these nice people.
