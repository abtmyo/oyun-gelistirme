00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:05,059
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows, this is Crash Course Games,
and today we’re going to get down to business.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,360
Specifically, the business of video games.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,520
Until the 1970s, computer and video games
were created by individuals with access to expensive,

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,600
difficult to use computers that were frequently
housed in institutions like universities.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,080
The general public wasn’t playing video games, and the number of people making games was miniscule.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,360
But there was a community of students and academics who did play early video games on university computers,

7
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,310
and some of them envisioned a world where
video games could reach a wide audience,

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,449
and at the same time be very, very profitable.

9
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,989
Now, if you’ve seen any of our Crash Course
History series, you know we usually don’t

10
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,879
go in for so-called “great man” history.

11
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,889
The idea that individuals can shift the course
of history is, in most cases, false.

12
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:51,509
But, in the case of Video Game history, a guy named Nolan Bushnell really did manage to change everything.

13
00:00:51,509 --> 00:01:00,189
[Theme Music]

14
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:05,940
Nolan Bushnell got interested in computers in the 1960s while he was a student at the University of Utah.

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,260
The school was an important center of computer
graphics research at the time,

16
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:16,040
and while Bushnell was there, he came across a PDP-1 that played Steve “Slug” Russell’s Spacewar! (exclamation point)

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,600
Bushnell loved the game, and he loved working
with the computers that ran the game.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,740
He played Spacewar! a lot so he could learn all he could about computers and programming languages.

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,880
Incidentally, Bushnell also worked as a barker
on the midway at an amusement park,

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,840
where his job was to convince people to spend their money on playing games like the ring toss.

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,100
It was his amusement park experience
coupled with his knowledge of technology

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,080
that helped him birth an industry.

23
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,380
After college he created a prototype for his
own game called Computer Space,

24
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,500
which shared a lot of gameplay similarities with our old favorite, Spacewar! (exclamation point)

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,340
Bushnell partnered with Nutting & Associates, a company that manufactured coin operated bar trivia games,

26
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,420
to produce a commercial version of Computer Space.
It didn’t go that great.

27
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,780
Although they put the game in an amazing looking
space age fiberglass cabinet,

28
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,509
they only only sold around 1000 copies of
the game.

29
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:10,229
That’s less copies than Wii music. If you
don’t know what Wii Music is, my point exactly.

30
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,320
Bushnell squarely blamed Computer Space’s failure on Nutting & Associated, and decided to form his own company.

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,640
He and a partner came up with the princely
sum of $500, and after trying out the name

32
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,100
Syzygy. Syzygy? Syzygy?

33
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,830
It has the distinction of being hard to pronounce
AND spell.

34
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,880
He named the company Atari instead.
Thank goodness.

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,600
They took the name from the ancient Japanese
strategy game, Go.

36
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,690
Apparently, the word Atari refers to a situation
where one player’s piece is in danger of

37
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,470
being captured on the next turn.

38
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,810
Some players would speak the word aloud at this point, kind of like saying “check” during a chess game.

39
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,010
It turns out though, actually saying Atari
during a game is considered kind of rude,

40
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,790
and something an inexperienced player would do;
something that would be frowned on by the 'real' players.

41
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,040
How rude.
That’s kind of fitting, though.

42
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,240
As we’ll see here in a minute, Nolan Bushnell’s Atari was definitely a newcomer in the entertainment industry,

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,820
and he wasn’t above being rude, and disrupting
the traditional players in the game.

44
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,520
Atari moved into a small warehouse, and hired
a handful of employees.

45
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,480
One of these employees would turn out to be
a crucial early asset to the company.

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,800
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.
Al Alcorn was an early hire.

47
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,240
He was a computer scientist and mechanical
engineer,

48
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,070
and Bushnell tasked him with creating Atari’s
first game.

49
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,930
While Bushnell was enthusiastic about computers
and electronics,

50
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,320
he needed someone with more engineering experience
to design the games.

51
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,140
Bushnell assigned Alcorn to create a table
tennis simulation, and in a week and a half,

52
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,410
Alcorn delivered a hand-wired version of the
game that became Pong.

53
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,720
The game was rough and incomplete and seemingly
built with stuff from around the house.

54
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,660
The onscreen white bars that represented players’
paddles were placeholders,

55
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,790
intended to be replaced with fancy graphics
that looked like human players.

56
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,810
The cabinet was cobbled together out of spare
parts, with an off the shelf TV for a monitor,

57
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,730
and a bread pan to collect the quarters.

58
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,580
Bushnell, foreshadowing a habit of rushing products to market, thought all those half-measures were just fine,

59
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,780
and they installed the game in a local bar
for playtesting. It was an immediate success.

60
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,260
According to video game historian David Ellis, the bar started attracting patrons who only wanted to play Pong.

61
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,210
The game was so popular that at one point
the prototype machine stopped working because

62
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,970
there were too many quarters in the bread
pan.

63
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,920
Atari moved Pong into mass production, and despite some manufacturing hiccups, the game was a success.

64
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,030
But Atari’s success bred competition.

65
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,620
Within a year of Pong’s release other major gaming companies in the US began making knock-offs of it.

66
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,360
Companies that had built their businesses on carnival games and electro mechanical games like pinball machines,

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,240
and that dumb skill claw game, suddenly jumped
into the video game business.

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,450
Williams had Paddle Ball, Chicago Coin had
Olympic TV Hockey, Sega had Hockey TV,

69
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,730
Taito had Pro Hockey, and Brunswick had Astro
Hockey.

70
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,930
All of these looked and played like Pong,
and these clones cut into Atari’s business.

71
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,140
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
So how did this happen?

72
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,730
Well, according to video game historian Steven Kent, the company failed to apply for patents before releasing the game,

73
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,700
which allowed competitors to enter the market
with very similar games.

74
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,420
In addition to stiff competition, Atari ran into trouble with distributors of coin-operated games.

75
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,940
At the time, the industry was controlled only a handful of game distributors in each region of the country,

76
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,600
and each of these distributors wanted an exclusive
contract to sell Atari products in their area.

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,480
Bushnell wanted to sell games to all the distributors, but Atari had already signed a bunch of these contracts.

78
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,120
So, in a move that some might see unethical,
he hired his neighbor to run a new company,

79
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,460
Kee Games, which produced clones of Atari
games with different names.

80
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,240
This allowed Bushnell to sell Atari game machines
to one distributor and Kee games to another,

81
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,840
increasing sales without violating his contracts.

82
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,740
Eventually this deception was found out, but luckily, by that time Atari’s games were so popular,

83
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,870
and generated so much money for distributors
that they overlooked the contract violations.

84
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,280
This was the beginning of the end for the
exclusive distribution contract,

85
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,560
and it paved the way for Arcade games to become
national hits, rather than regional phenomena.

86
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,980
For much of the 1970’s, Atari continued to produce hit after hit for the coin-operated game industry.

87
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,080
In 1974 they created Gotcha, an early maze
game like Pac-man.

88
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:02,030
And Atari struck gold in 1976 with a variant of
Pong called Breakout. OK. It’s time to LEVEL UP.

89
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,270
So this is Breakout which is really cool to
play.

90
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,660
Hopefully, I’m better at this than I was
at Spacewar!

91
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,320
As you can see this is the Atari 2600 home
version of Breakout not the arcade version.

92
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,180
And I’m playing it on a Ouya controller so if I don’t do well I’m going to blame the controller.

93
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,570
I would be much better if I had the Atari
controller in my hand. Let’s go with that.

94
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:26,140
Alright here we go, so you have a paddle at
the bottom and eventually you will start the game.

95
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:31,380
And when you start the game a little ball or block
comes down. Oh, and I already missed it.

96
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,440
Now what’s interesting about this game is
the story behind it.

97
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,440
You see Nolan Bushnell asked an employee to specifically make this game,

98
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,900
that employee that he asked, was this guy, you might have heard of him, his name is Steve Jobs.

99
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,440
So Steve actually asked his friend, to help
him do this game.

100
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,780
His friend being Steve Wozniak - some good
company to have.

101
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,760
Wozniak actually finished making the game
in four days. They called it the Four Day Wonder.

102
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,120
It’s going to take me four days to hit one
of these balls.

103
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,500
Breakout actually influenced other game designers
like Tomohiro Nishikado,

104
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,680
the creator of Space Invaders, he said he wouldn’t have made that game if it wasn’t for Breakout.

105
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,320
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak went on to make
this little company called Apple in 1976,

106
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:22,280
and Steve Wozniak has even said that his designs and influence on the Apple II came from working on Breakout.

107
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:29,940
So, you have this little bouncing ball, rainbow
breaking game to thank for the Apple Company,

108
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,240
the Apple II, and the vision of Wozniak.

109
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,500
Alright, I think I’m done with Breakout.
I did the best I could with it.

110
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,730
I really recommend playing this game.

111
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,730
It’s a fun game but play the arcade or play
it with an old school Atari controller.

112
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,410
To really get the feel of how it was to play
this game back in the 70’s.

113
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,640
Now, if Atari’s pioneering commercialization
of video games was the company’s only contribution

114
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,980
to the history of video games, we might have
still done a whole episode on it.

115
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,800
But Atari was also vital to the other major
change video games underwent in the 1970’s.

116
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,060
Atari’s next step toward dominating the hearts
and wallets of consumers was a home invasion.

117
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,139
They started making video games people could
play at home.

118
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,510
After Pong’s initial arcade success, Atari
produced a home version of the game that consumers

119
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,120
could play on their home televisions.

120
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,600
They sold these games through Sears, and they
sold a lot of them.

121
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,010
It became clear that the gaming frontier was
in consumers’ living rooms.

122
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:25,919
In 1977 Atari released the Atari 2600 in all
its simulated wood-grain glory.

123
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,919
The console didn’t see immediate success,
largely due to it’s high price

124
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:34,179
-- $199 that’s about $777 when you
adjust it for inflation --

125
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,620
and the fact that there were only about 10
games available at launch.

126
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:41,380
But technologically, the Atari 2600 was miles
ahead of the competition.

127
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,339
While there were other home video consoles
on the market that had a few games built in,

128
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,299
Atari’s real innovation with the 2600 was
the interchangeable game cartridge.

129
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,840
Interchangeable games meant that players could buy and play new games without replacing the entire console.

130
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,579
And that meant lots of cartridge sales for
Atari.

131
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,889
This move into the home made games more accessible
and a larger part of our everyday life.

132
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:06,490
The success of the Atari 2600 spawned the
console wars of the second part of the 1970’s

133
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,420
and wormed its way into the popular culture.

134
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,660
You can see the Atari 2600 in movies, like
Airplane, Blade Runner, and of course E.T.

135
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,440
But we’ll get to that later.

136
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,520
The company would continue to dominate the
industry throughout the 70’s and into the 80’s,

137
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,480
creating classics like Centipede, Tempest, and Pitfall until the great video game crash of the 1980’s.

138
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,860
Atari isn’t dead, the company continues
on today, and still produces games.

139
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,819
But Nolan Bushnell is no longer involved,
and it isn’t anything like the innovative,

140
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:37,239
disruptive, and for a while, dominant force
that it once was.

141
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,040
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next week,
and just one more time - ATARI!

142
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,220
Crash Course Games is filmed in The Chad and
Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana,

143
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,360
