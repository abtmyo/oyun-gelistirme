00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash
Course Games.

2
00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:05,410
Today we’re going to take a brief look at
the world of PC Gaming.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,300
That’s right PC Master Race we’ve got you covered.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,780
Because computers did start the video game
age after all.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,280
They were the precursor of the console, hand-held systems, and all other technological gaming genres.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,320
But just because PC Games led to all the other types of video games doesn’t mean they’re antiquated.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,920
PC gamers prefer playing on computers because they provide a gaming landscape where players, designers, and developers intermingle.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:32,200
Players can alter and modify their systems and games to their tastes, and unlike on consoles, designers and developers craft games untethered to a single machine.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:41,060
And this world of PC Gaming is so diverse and imaginative that you might find games like Meatboy, 7th Guest, and RollerCoaster Tycoon all on the same computer.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,800
And Minesweeper don’t forget Minesweeper.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,180
PC Gaming continues to be a powerhouse and
the foundation for all modern video games.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,500
So let’s take a look at how they got their
start and where they are going in the future.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:59,440
[Theme Music]

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,140
So, pretty much as soon as computers appeared after World War II, people started making games to play on them.

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,180
But you’ve seen those early computer pictures.
They were huge.

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:15,560
It wasn’t until the microprocessor was developed in the 1960s and 70s, when computers morphed from room-sized behemoths to the desktop, and eventually to the handheld ones we know today.

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:24,000
In 1974, MITS or the Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems Company introduced the Altair 8800, a build-it-yourself computer kit.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,980
It didn’t have a keyboard or screen, but it did give feedback through a row of lights that flashed back at people.

19
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,730
This is considered the first commercially
successful PC.

20
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,290
But home computers didn’t grab the public’s
gaming imagination at first.

21
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,710
It was the advent of arcade machines that
did it.

22
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,840
Games like Pong, Gun Fight, and Lunar Lander filled arcades all over the world due to their ease of play and availability.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,380
This in turn led to home consoles like the Odyssey, Atari, and ColecoVision, which we talked about earlier in the series.

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,820
At the same time, PCs were evolving at an
amazing rate.

25
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:59,820
Computer gaming continued to grow, and by the late 1970’s video games began to split into two different, though intrinsically linked lines.

26
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,580
On one side you had the dedicated gaming consoles that eventually lead to Nintendo, Sega, Xbox, and Playstation.

27
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,260
On the other side, we saw PC gaming nestle
deep into the world of computers.

28
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:15,440
Interesting enough, the rise of PC Gaming began in the US just before the Great Video Game Crash of 1983.

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,360
The Crash caused the public to lose faith
in home consoles.

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,440
And PCs were there with open arms to quickly
welcome this new audience.

31
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,610
How did PCs survive?

32
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:28,099
Well, after the crash they were clever to advertise themselves as machines that could do more than simply play games.

33
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,059
They sold the public on the PC's ability to
multi-task.

34
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,160
Yes, you could play games, but you could also manage taxes, study geography, and do homework too.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,100
PC sales began to grow, and games came along
with them.

36
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,140
The classic Commodore 64 is a great example
of the PC's success at this time.

37
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,100
It came out in 1982 and was founded by computer
businessman Jack Tramiel.

38
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:54,580
During its 12 year lifespan, over 17 million units were sold and a staggering 10,000 commercial programs were made.

39
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,120
Technologically-speaking, the Commodore 64
was a huge step forward.

40
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,840
It ran on a MOS 6510 microprocessor that gave
it 64 kilobytes of RAM. Wow.

41
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,220
The display could create 16 colors, 40 columns,
and 25 lines of text with a 320 x 200 resolution.

42
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,500
That might all sound quaint today but back
then that was cutting edge.

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,100
What kept people coming back was the ever-increasing
games and program library.

44
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,620
You could find a program on just about anything for the C64, there were 10 thousand of them remember?

45
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,480
But if you couldn’t, and had the skills,
you could probably program it yourself.

46
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,740
And that sense of openness and opportunity for experimentation can still be found in many PC gamers today.

47
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:37,100
In the United Kingdom, another early computer would also heavily influence the industry - the ZX Spectrum.

48
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,580
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

49
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:47,720
Released by Sinclair Research Ltd in 1982, the ZX Spectrum, with its efficient design, was the brainchild of the company’s founder Sir Clive Sinclair.

50
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,120
He was literally a genius -- the guy designed a compact submarine at the age of 14 -- and a lover for all things computer.

51
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,240
One of Sinclair’s first creations was the
ZX80.

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,620
It had a great price point but was underpowered,
even for the day.

53
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,120
It barely had 900 bytes of RAM.

54
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,100
In today’s terms that’s about six tweets.

55
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,220
Thankfully Sinclair learned from his mistakes.

56
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,080
The ZX Spectrum addressed a lot of the early issues, and would go on to become a British gaming institution.

57
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,340
While it still had a few shortcomings and was received poorly everywhere else in the world,

58
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,040
the ZX Spectrum had more influence over gaming in the U.K. than the original NES.

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,560
There were six magazines and well over 24,000
games devoted to the Spectrum.

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,360
It was so successful that Sinclair was knighted
by Queen Elizabeth II.

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,140
The system became a point of national pride and even won out against more technologically sound PCs like the Commodore 64.

62
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:44,080
The Spectrum inspired generations of game creators such as Chris Davis, the one man team of Mouldy Toof Studios and developer of The Escapists.

63
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,840
Davis cited the Spectrum as his inspiration,
saying that,

64
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,340
“My interest in making games started back
as a kid with the ZX Spectrum.

65
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,640
While all of my friends were moving into the 16-bit era, the Spectrum was my first proper dose of video gaming.”

66
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,780
Thanks Thought Bubble!

67
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:04,100
So, by the start of the 1990’s, PC Gaming was moving towards a golden age, ushering in a number of unique gaming experiences that could only be found on a PC.

68
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,560
Let’s start with real-time strategy or RTS.

69
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:15,960
This genre of PC game play focuses on securing locations and destroying your opponent’s assets through resource gathering, base building, technological development, and indirect control of units.

70
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,740
Dune II: the Building of a Dynasty was one of the first games to establish RTS as we know it today.

71
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,500
The game was released in 1992 and included key elements of RTS such as a world map to choose the next mission,

72
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,789
different factions, mobile and base unit construction, and funding through resource gathering.

73
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:36,649
But what really made RTS and Dune II special was the use of the mouse and keyboard to move units within the game.

74
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:39,539
According to its co-designer and lead programmer,
Joe Bostic,

75
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,840
"This greatly facilitated precise player control, which enabled the player to give orders to individual units.

76
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,639
The mouse, and the direct control it allowed,
was critical in making the RTS genre possible.”

77
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,119
This game has gone on to inspire other monumental
games such as Starcraft and Warcraft.

78
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,800
First person shooters also flourished in the
PC space.

79
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,960
Using 3D graphics, these games allowed players much greater freedom of movement, compared to many other games of the time.

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,040
Wolfenstein 3D is the game that really made
this genre popular.

81
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:13,800
Released in 1992 on MS-DOS, interestingly as shareware, Wolfenstein helped establish the basic mechanics of this genre and still heavily influences FPS games today.

82
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,840
Not to mention serving as the template for Doom.

83
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,260
And we can’t talk about PC games without
mentioning simulators.

84
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:25,920
Simulators attempt to simulate real life activities like flight or surgery by allowing for freely controlled characters and environments.

85
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,760
Now it can be argued that some simulators aren’t actually games as many are used for on-the-job training or education vs leisure play.

86
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,920
But one of the most popular simulators, that
is definitely a game, is SimCity.

87
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,960
Released in 1989 (okay, not quite the 90s, but close enough) SimCity simulated various aspects of city management.

88
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,140
The game also features one of the defining aspects of simulation - that there is no clearly defined goal for the player to achieve.

89
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,120
And game publishers weren’t too receptive to the idea, thinking that the game would sell poorly.

90
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,600
But SimCity was a runaway success selling
an estimated 1 million copies by 1992.

91
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,300
I even owned a copy of SimCity, but I owned it on Super Nintendo don’t judge me it had Bowser in it.

92
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,100
Now, we know that puzzles aren’t technically considered games, but throw puzzle solving into a narrative and you’ve got yourself an adventure.

93
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,719
The adventure genre is typically designed for a single player who acts as the protagonist of the story, solving puzzles to progress through the game.

94
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,780
Now, the initial adventure games were text-based, where the computer would translate the input into commands for the game.

95
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,020
As PCs became more powerful, graphics were
added to create an illustrated narrative.

96
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,620
Take Myst for example.

97
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:31,400
Originally released in 1993, players walked around an oddly quiet and mysterious island attempting to solve various puzzles and riddles.

98
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,480
This game was unusual for the time because it provided little character backstory, there was no physical violence, and no goals laid out for the player.

99
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,320
I'm sensing a trend here with PC games.

100
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:48,620
But Myst was a huge success and helped pave a new avenue in the puzzle gaming genre, inspiring games like 7th Guest, 11th Hour, and even its own sequel.

101
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:52,220
Also, we can thank Myst for helping drive
the adoption of the CD-ROM.

102
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,600
You’re welcome Playstation and other future
gaming consoles.

103
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,039
With the 90s, we also see the rise of LAN
parties or Local Area Network parties.

104
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,899
These were gatherings where people could connect
their computers to play multi-player games.

105
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:10,100
In 2013, Sweden saw the biggest LAN party to date with over 17,000 devices connected during the DreamHack festival.

106
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,400
Today, we see unprecedented access to PC games.

107
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,080
Internet portal sites are popping up, like NewGrounds and Kongregate, delivering gaming to millions.

108
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,100
Sites like Neopets have become commonplace,
allowing anyone to log in and play from anywhere.

109
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,220
PC gaming has also led to the rise of gaming
platforms like Steam by Valve.

110
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,500
Steam is an online service that distributes games and other media created by developers to its shared subscriber base.

111
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,139
Officially released in 2003, Valve has continued to thrive for years, and may be ushering in the next golden age of PC gaming.

112
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:48,620
There are over 125 million active Steam users worldwide, and the system has over 4500 games and 400 million items created by users.

113
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,000
Valve even has its own VR unit but we’ll
get into that in the next episode.

114
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,220
And PC Gaming really sets itself apart because both players and creators can take part in the creation process.

115
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,500
Take mods, for example, where people alter a game mechanic to their own, often bizarre, liking.

116
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,780
The practice of modding has led to all kinds of wonderfully bizarre, funny, and challenging new games like Macho Man Randy Savage in Skyrim.

117
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,200
Or Marty McFly and his time-traveling Delorean on the streets of San Andreas in Grand Theft Auto.

118
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,000
This could also lead to a problem like cheating
but I digress.

119
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,980
Not going to get into that.
That’s your conscience.

120
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,940
It’s clear that PC gaming is thriving, and continues to inform many games on a variety of platforms.

121
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,220
Some game genres truly are best when played on a PC, and many great games can only be played on this platform.

122
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,360
PC gaming has inspired originality in game
development like no other platform.

123
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,250
It’s come a long way since Minesweeper.

124
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,690
Which can someone really tell me the rules
of Minesweeper I still don’t get it.

125
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,890
Thanks for watching and we’ll see you next
time!

126
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,720
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and
Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana,

127
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,840
and it's made with the help of all these nice
people.
