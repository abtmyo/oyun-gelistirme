00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash Course Games. Last week we focused on the dawn of

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,430
the video game industry, and the early dominance
of the Atari, but Atari didn’t exist in a vacuum.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,620
There were many other companies vying for players quarters, and trying to get their consoles into players’ homes.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,220
Home consoles allowed for video games to integrate
deeply into people’s lives,

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,690
and were important to the evolution of the
industry and the artform.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,620
So if we’re going to get a handle on early
video game history,

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:31,080
we’re going to have to look at the rest of the video game industry during the funky 1970s. Can you dig it.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:39,760
[Theme Music]

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,040
Now although Atari did come to dominate the
competition with their beloved 2600,

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,780
Atari didn’t invent the home video game
console.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,860
Game historians generally point to the Magnavox Odyssey as the early pioneer in getting games onto home televisions.

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,579
The Odyssey was the brain-child of a man named Ralph Baer, who’s been called the Father of Video Games,

13
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,159
not to be confused with Nolan Bushnell who has been called The Father of the Video Gaming Industry.

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,080
Ralph Baer was born in Germany in 1922, migrated to America, and began a lifelong love affair with technology.

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,720
In 1951, Ralph conceived an idea for an interactive
TV device.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,440
But he couldn’t get his employers interested
in the idea.

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,900
But like any good unappreciated genius
he struggled on for the next 15 years,

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,840
until he was able to make his dream a reality.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,980
By 1966, prices for televisions had fallen, and TVs were in over 40 million homes in the United States.

20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,800
Once Baer’s idea finally started moving, like a lot of developments in early video gaming, things happened fast.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,340
He drew up schematics for a new console in
a less than a week,

22
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,120
and his employers were impressed enough to
assign a small development team to the project.

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,520
By 1967, the team had a working table tennis
game, that would later go on to inspire Atari’s Pong.

24
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:52,729
They called the system the Brown-Box and began
shopping it around to large manufacturers.

25
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:58,400
They eventually licensed the technology to the Magnavox corporation, and the Odyssey appeared in stores in 1972.

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,260
Now the Odyssey wasn’t a game system as
we think about them today.

27
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,819
Rather than using game software that runs
on a computer, like later consoles,

28
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:09,419
the Odyssey’s "games" were really just electrical
connectors in a massive circuit between the

29
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,780
television and the system.

30
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,530
The Odyssey featured game cards that were
inserted into the machine,

31
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,090
which closed different loops in the giant
circuit, and changed the output to the television.

32
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,570
The games were all very similar, and
extremely simple by today's standards,

33
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,870
but at the time, they were kind of amazing.

34
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,400
While the Odyssey was simple, it was also
revolutionary,

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,420
and it launched with a lot of features that
would become standard in video consoles.

36
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,879
It featured one of gaming’s earliest commercial
light guns, allowing players to shoot at their

37
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,120
“screen” and hunt dinosaurs and ghosts.

38
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,569
The Odyssey’s development team also determined
that game systems should be hooked up to TVs,

39
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:46,329
and presented on channels 3 or 4, which became the console industry’s standard procedure for decades.

40
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:51,349
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, The Odyssey was
groundbreaking, and amazing, and inspirational,

41
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,439
but it was quickly improved upon and subsequently
forgotten.

42
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:01,499
Atari’s Video Computer System or VCS 2600 hit the market in 1977, and once again revolutionized home gaming.

43
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,560
The Atari 2600 was a massive improvement over
the Magnavox Odyssey.

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,920
The console was the first to feature two joysticks, which made home gaming feel more like playing in an arcade.

45
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,880
The games were also much more graphically
complex, and they were in color! Just like real life!

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,280
Look at those graphics! That looks, like,
real! Real world right there on my TV!

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,600
Adventure set the standard for the exploratory
game genre and influenced video games like

48
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,629
The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Tomb
Raider.

49
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:31,980
Adventure also contained the first “Easter
Egg”, or hidden feature.

50
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,260
At the time, Atari’s leadership didn’t
give individual designers and developers any

51
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,009
sort of public facing credits for the games
they made.

52
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:42,100
Those unskippable credit rolls at the end
of games, they weren’t a thing yet.

53
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:45,289
The game’s designer, Warren Robbinett,
didn’t like the lack of recognition,

54
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:48,529
so he built a room into the game with his name in it.

55
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:52,469
This took up 5% of his game’s overall storage;
not insignificant.

56
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:56,600
That “feature” stayed hidden from the
non-crediting jerks in Atari management until

57
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:01,310
after the game had sold hundreds of thousands
of copies, and a young player wrote a letter

58
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,709
asking about the message.
Spoiler alert: the developer didn’t get fired.

59
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,689
And in the decades since, designers have
been hiding small surprises in their games,

60
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,520
and players have been delighted in finding them.

61
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:14,439
Another thing Atari helped introduce to gaming
culture was third-party developers.

62
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,620
Several disgruntled key employees from Atari
left the company.

63
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,549
They were upset at the lack of recognition,
unless they pulled a Warren Robbinett and

64
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:23,949
put their name in the game as an Easter Egg,
and because they also weren’t happy with

65
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:25,060
how the company was managed.

66
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,900
They founded Activision, the first outside company
that developed games for the Atari 2600.

67
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,280
This is now standard practice in the video
game world.

68
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,000
Actually Activision is still doing it themselves
with games like Call of Duty and Skylanders.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,139
While Atari had the dominant home console,
it was not alone in the video game market.

70
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,699
Toy company Mattel got into the act and released
the Intellivision in 1979.

71
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,160
While it was able to grab some of Atari’s market share, it never managed to overtake the 2600.

72
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,100
But the Intellivision system was known for
its improved graphics and sound quality.

73
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,560
But the system’s controllers, that looked
like calculators, literally they had numbers on them,

74
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,160
they have been called some of the most uncomfortable controllers ever made.

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,080
Sorry Intellivision, I’m just keeping it 100. Which I can actually type on your calculator-looking controller.

76
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,660
Now here is where it starts getting nasty:
Mattel put up a strong marketing fight against Atari

77
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,389
by showing side-by-side comparison ads with
political commentator George Plimpton.

78
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,271
These were some of the first ads to directly
tout the supremacy of one system over another.

79
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,540
Something I think we’re going to see again
in the future.

80
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,900
And while Mattel’s console was always second string, the company did contribute some genuine gaming innovations.

81
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,700
In 1977, the company released one of the first
hand-held games, Mattel Electronics’ Football,

82
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,500
an ancestor to the many handheld
gaming devices that followed,

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,360
like GameBoys, Nintendo 3DS, Game Gear, Atari Lynx.

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,320
See Mattel you were better than Atari in the
mobile market.

85
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,660
By 1978 Mattel was selling upwards to 500,000
of these handheld games per week.

86
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,060
Gaming had been brewing across the Pacific
in Japan for some time,

87
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:59,169
and an invasion of the alien landed in America.
Thanks to Space Invaders.

88
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:06,240
Designed by 34yr old Tomohiro Nishikado, made by Taito of Japan, and released in America in 1978 by Midway.

89
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,040
Space invaders was a massive hit in arcades,
and demand for home versions of it helped

90
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,460
spur on the success of the Atari console.

91
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,740
Space Invaders was the first official licensing of an arcade game and this quadrupled the Atari 2600’s sales.

92
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,650
Space Invaders was one of the early successes
for a Japanese game in the American market,

93
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,659
but it would by no means be the last.

94
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:31,490
Space Invaders’ success foreshadowed the
future success of Japanese gaming giants like

95
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,750
this one company you might have heard of them,
um, Sega.

96
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,880
And there was this other company before that, uh, you might of heard of it, I don’t know, named Nintendo.

97
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,220
Does that ring a bell? You know what we’ll
get into that next time. Thanks for watching.

98
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,300
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and
Stacy Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

99
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,480
and it’s made with the help of all these
nice people.

100
