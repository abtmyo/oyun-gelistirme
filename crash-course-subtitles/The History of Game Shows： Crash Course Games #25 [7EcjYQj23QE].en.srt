00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Hi I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,940
If you’ve ever stayed home sick on a weekday and channel surfed, you’re probably familiar with today’s topic: game shows.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:17,600
While it might seem like there’s not much substance to the genre that brought us such shows as Cash Cab and Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, they’ve actually been an important part of United States culture since the 1920s.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,700
Now game shows are slightly different from
the other games we’ve discussed in this series.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,260
You’re probably more likely to play Poker
in your lifetime than be a contestant on Jeopardy.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,500
But that doesn’t mean that they don’t
impact our lives.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,220
In fact, according to research, watching a game show might not be that much different than actually playing one.

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:41,460
[Theme Music]

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,020
Game shows started on an ancient device known
as the radio.

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,920
Back then, they were known as quiz shows.

11
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,449
And their predecessors were activities like
puzzles, spelling bees, and contests.

12
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:59,249
In the 1920s, some radio shows started to incorporate question and answer segments, though they didn’t become truly popular until 1935 on NBC’s Vox Pop.

13
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:01,870
The show brought in regular people to answer
questions for prizes.

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,780
Not only was this the first quiz show, it's considered one of the first shows to use audience participation.

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,020
By the end of the decade, quiz shows were on all the major radio networks, and it wasn’t just an American phenomenon.

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,280
In 1937, the Inter-regional Spelling Competition
premiered on BBC Radio.

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,040
England also had the first TV game show, 1938’s
Spelling Bee.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,080
Two major game show varieties evolved.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,680
Quiz shows were a pretty simple question-and-answer
format.

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,000
A popular example was the radio show Winner
Take All, which premiered in 1946.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,280
In the game, a host asked a question to two contestants, then whoever buzzed in first could answer.

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,760
This is a mechanic we see in many game shows
up to this day.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,380
Then, there were panel shows featuring celebrity
panelists.

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,820
So, instead of an ordinary contestant, these
people might be experts or comedians.

25
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,560
The first-ever show of this genre was 1938’s
Information Please.

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,240
Audience members submitted questions for the
panelists to answer.

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,740
People who sent in questions that got used
would win money.

28
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:53,669
And if the questions stumped the panel, they
won even more.

29
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:56,940
Modern examples of panel shows include Match
Game and Hollywood Squares.

30
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:06,780
I should note here that quiz shows also evolved into some other categories including giveaway shows (which were less knowledge-based) and stunt programs (in which contestants attempted a certain stunt).

31
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,320
In the 1930s, social scientist Herta Herzog set out to learn why people tuned into these types of shows.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,100
She interviewed eight women and three men
about the radio program Professor Quiz.

33
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,010
And, she found some similarities between the
quiz show listeners.

34
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,820
They preferred to listen to a contestant who was most like themselves a.k.a. the “average” person.

35
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,520
And they tended to be competitive; when a contestant made a mistake, it often caused a boost in the listener’s self-esteem.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:38,860
This is an interesting distinction – even though audience members aren’t actively playing in a game show, they still experience the competitive urges that accompany many other types of games that we’ve discussed in this series.

37
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,480
We’ll delve into some more science a little later,
but for now: BACK TO HISTORY.

38
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,020
Above all, these shows were entertainment.

39
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,820
And the ones with more comedic elements tended
to do better as the genre developed.

40
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,640
In 1946, journalist Maurice Zolotow referenced this phenomenon in an article for the Saturday Evening Post.

41
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:01,960
He wrote, “Today a quiz program is mainly designed to exhibit slices of life, to present a cross section of strange, wonderful, bizarre and queer specimens of humanity.

42
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,050
Frequently the dumber a contestant is, the
funnier he sounds on the air.”

43
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,070
Sounds a little bit like the Real Housewives
and Bachelorette contestants, doesn’t it?

44
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,100
Which isn’t a coincidence – we’ll get
into that later.

45
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,450
Zolotow wasn’t totally wrong.

46
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,330
Eventually, stunt and giveaway shows started
gaining on the original quiz show format.

47
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,720
Audiences wanted something flashy – like people winning $1,000 by sheer random luck on the radio show Pot o’ Gold.

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,760
And what the audience wants matters because these shows have always been supported by advertisers.

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,500
So it’s probably obvious based on how many examples I’ve just given you, but these shows were hugely popular – they even changed the lifestyles of some Americans.

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,660
For example, Pot o’ Gold called people randomly
on Tuesday nights.

51
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,000
Just answering the phone got you the $1,000.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,520
If not, you received $100 as a consolation
prize.

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,600
There were noticeable reductions in phone calls made on Tuesday because people didn't want to tie up their phone lines in case they had won.

54
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,720
There was also a drop in movie theatre attendance because people wanted to stay home, just in case.

55
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,800
It got to the point where some theatre owners
started offering their own consolation prizes.

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,280
If Pot o’ Gold happened to call a person while they were at the movies, the owner promised to give them the $1,000.

57
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,200
In the 1940s, quiz shows popped up on American television where they became the thing to watch.

58
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,980
Some earned up to a 50% rating share in the early days, meaning that half of U.S. televisions were tuned in.

59
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,360
But these quiz shows encountered some setbacks, most notably in the 1950s when they went through a huge scandal.

60
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,340
A few quiz shows were at its center involving rigged contests including The $64,000 Question and Dotto.

61
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,140
But, we’re going to focus on a program called
Twenty-One.

62
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:32,360
As I mentioned earlier, these shows were important to advertisers, who wanted good ratings, and for Twenty-One, they were falling.

63
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,160
Producers knew that good numbers came when the shows were exciting and the audience’s favorite contestants won.

64
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,100
In this case, that contestant was a 30-year-old
man named Charles Van Doren.

65
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,780
Before appearing on the show in the late 1950s, he was a relatively well-known English professor at Columbia.

66
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,500
So you can probably guess what happened: the
producers staged the show.

67
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,140
They gave Van Doren the answers and they told
his opponent, Herb Stempel, to lose on purpose.

68
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:03,800
Stempel later recalled that they gave him, “this old, ill-fitting suit and this Marine-type haircut was to make me appear as what you would call today, a nerd, a square."

69
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,810
He was made to look less attractive than his
opponent – true audience manipulation.

70
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,180
The producers didn’t script just one show
either.

71
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:20,100
Van Doren won episode after episode, earning a total of $128,000 on a streak going from November 28th, 1956 through March 11th, 1957.

72
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,720
Eventually he “lost,” but the ordeal earned
him a three-year contract with NBC.

73
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,400
Soon after, Stempel (and contestants on other fixed shows) came forward with the truth, igniting a huge scandal.

74
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,940
President Dwight D. Eisenhower called it,
“a terrible thing to do to the American public.”

75
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,860
It might not sound so shocking to you, since we’re all pretty accustomed to not-real reality television.

76
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,260
But, before this moment, the majority of Americans didn’t have the same level of skepticism when it came to entertainment.

77
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,020
They took radio and television at face value.

78
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,440
In 1960, an amendment was added to the Communications Act of 1934, outlawing prearranged outcomes

79
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,169
“with intent to deceive the listening or
viewing public.”

80
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:05,139
Shows could no longer legally “supply to any contestant in a purportedly bona fide contest of intellectual knowledge or intellectual skill any special and secret assistance.”

81
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,720
These strict regulations led the networks
to create standards and practices departments.

82
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,130
And by the 1960s most quiz shows were moved
from primetime television to daytime and rebranded.

83
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,340
That’s part of the reason why you’re more likely to hear the term “game show” than “quiz show” now.

84
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:26,140
Sure, traditional question-and-answer quiz show formats remained, but there was also the introduction of many “game shows” which require more specific skills and rules.

85
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:35,820
Olaf Hoerschelmann, author of Rules of the Game: Quiz Shows and American Culture, views that as a huge shift – the shows went from being highbrow to being perceived as “entertainment forms with low prestige."

86
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,300
They also became flashier

87
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,480
The new goal was to redirect attention from daytime household tasks to the television, so music and sound effects became mainstays.

88
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,500
[sound effect noises]

89
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,980
Tons of shows that you can still watch today
began during this era.

90
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,550
Jeopardy! premiered in 1964 on NBC.

91
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,750
The Price Is Right began in 1956 on NBC before
moving to ABC, then CBS.

92
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,810
And also dating shows like The Dating Game
emerged in the mid-1960s.

93
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:10,520
Jumping forward to the 1990s, another innovation came to the format with increased audience participation in the form of call-in 900-numbers.

94
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,639
And we can’t talk about shows that incorporated phones without talking about Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? and American Idol.

95
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,110
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

96
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,670
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was originally a British game show, which ran from 1998 through 2014.

97
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,450
By 2003, 70 countries had franchised it.

98
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,410
It was an equally stressful show in every country,
as we know from the movie Slumdog Millionaire.

99
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,250
The U.S. version first aired on ABC in August
1999, hosted by Regis Philbin.

100
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,910
It was the most watched series from 1999-2000,
getting up to 30 million weekly viewers.

101
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,470
In four years, it earned ABC an estimated
$300 million in profits.

102
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:51,240
Game shows were BACK, and this represented a larger shift in American television in general: people wanted big prizes and reality.

103
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,560
In 1999, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? gave
out a million dollar prize.

104
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,440
Previously, the most money given out on an American game show was $312,700 on Tic-Tac-Dough in 1980.

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:10,000
During the same era, more shows with a similar competition format and huge prizes arrived in the U.S., but these were branded as reality shows.

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,940
Examples include American Idol, (another show originated from Britain), which aired in 2002 on Fox.

107
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,740
It was the most watched series from 2003-2011
consecutively.

108
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,000
And then there was the hit show Survivor.

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,479
It aired on CBS in 2000, and it was inspired
by a Swedish show called Expedition Robinson.

110
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,810
So, what’s the difference between a game
show and a “reality show”?

111
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,030
Well, it’s up for debate.

112
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,000
Reality shows have their origins in game shows,
so many consider them part of the genre.

113
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:39,909
The games I listed are often known as “reality
competition shows” or “reality game shows.”

114
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,689
Typically, when there’s a competition involved,
they’re viewed as offshoots from game shows.

115
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,500
But something more documentary-style Keeping
Up with the Kardashians, aren’t.

116
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:47,680
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

117
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,780
All right, so now that we’ve covered game show history, we need to talk about its overall impact.

118
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:57,700
Unlike some of the other forms of gaming we’ve talked about in this series, there are a couple different types of relationships a person can have with a game show.

119
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,019
There are the in-studio players and the audience.

120
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:03,619
Let’s start with in-studio players, otherwise
known as the contestants.

121
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:10,060
Something that sets game shows apart from the other games we’ve discussed is that there’s a camera focused on the player, so there’s added stress to the situation.

122
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,880
And the stakes are also extreme.

123
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,560
Often times, contestants are playing for big
money and fabulous prizes.

124
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,840
You can take a risk in a videogame, you just
restart.

125
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,440
But you take a risk in a game show, you could
lose a potential million dollars.

126
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,980
In 2008, the American Economic Review published a study addressing how people handle those stakes.

127
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,300
The authors focused on the risk-taking behaviors
of contestants on Deal Or No Deal.

128
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,820
If you’ve never seen it, a contestant picks
one briefcase out of around 26 options.

129
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,020
Each has an amount of money in it (from one cent to a million dollars in the American version, but it varies from country to country).

130
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,360
Then, the player chooses briefcases to open
revealing what ISN’T in theirs.

131
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,180
Periodically, they receive offers to buy their
briefcase; then they have to make a choice.

132
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,900
They have to decide whether to sell it, Deal, or keep playing in hopes of earning more money, No Deal.

133
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:57,279
The researchers found that quote, “Risk aversion decreases after earlier expectations have been shattered by unfavorable outcomes or surpassed by favorable outcomes.”

134
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:04,560
Basically, if a contestant opens the highest value briefcases first OR the lowest value ones, they’re going to be more prone to taking risks.

135
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,960
There’s an “important role of previous
outcomes.”

136
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,220
Though it’s worth noting that there’s
variety from contestant to contestant.

137
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,639
If they all acted the same, it would be a
pretty boring show.

138
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,220
We’ll get into this a bit more when we talk
about gambling.

139
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:23,540
A similar study was conducted in 1995 on Jeopardy! contestants and concluded that those players tend to have minimal risk aversion, also known as “risk-neutrality.”

140
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,150
We don’t know why these players are different
than Deal or No Deal ones.

141
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,980
There might be a difference in contestant knowledge – Jeopardy contestants are probably aware of their own intellect.

142
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,240
And it’s a game you can practice for.

143
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,220
No amount of practice is going to ensure that you pick the million dollar suitcase in Deal or No Deal.

144
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,380
It might also just be a matter of what type
of person is attracted to what game show.

145
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,200
Perhaps Jeopardy contestants are more steady in their willingness to take risks and Deal or No Deal ones are less consistent.

146
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,520
Of course you don’t have to be on a game
show to benefit from one.

147
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:56,940
In 2011, researchers tested the knowledge of fifth-year medical students with one group learning through a lecture and another through a Jeopardy-style game.

148
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,940
The researchers found that information retention was much higher in the group that learned the material in Jeopardy as opposed to the lecture.

149
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,340
Now let’s talk about the audience watching
the game shows.

150
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,600
I mentioned one study on the audience earlier which concluded that listeners of a quiz show experienced a competitive rush.

151
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,620
From the genre’s early beginnings, producers have attempted to create as much drama, competition, and spontaneity as possible.

152
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,440
But other than that, why do we like game shows
so much?

153
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,900
Well, according to research by Alan Rubin viewers also rank game shows high in terms of “entertainment, convenience, companionship, and relaxation.”

154
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:33,100
In another study conducted by Keith Roe and his colleagues, they narrowed down the main factors that draw people to watch game shows.

155
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:39,840
The main factors include that they involve “ordinary people” and contain “big” prizes that can be won by demonstrating “everyday knowledge.”

156
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:47,280
Basically, people like game shows that show it’s possible to win a ton of money or a new car or a dream vacation by just being themselves.

157
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:53,680
So that’s been a pretty whirlwind trip through game shows – from their radio origins in the 1920s to reality shows in the modern day.

158
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:01,640
From answering a question, solving the puzzle, guessing the password, or getting BIG BUCKS BIG BUCKS NO WHAMMYS, game shows have impacted audiences for decades.

159
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,860
We’ve talked before on the series about
how games are unique in their universal accessibility.

160
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,180
They’ve been enjoyed by people throughout
history and all over the world.

161
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,779
And in the U.S., entertainment and media are similarly accessible to the majority of the population – they’ve always permeated throughout our culture.

162
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,880
Honestly, there’s almost nothing more universal
than media here.

163
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,240
So, while game shows might seem like a small facet of the gaming genre as a whole, you can view them as a part of something much bigger than themselves.

164
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,180
And as contestants and viewers alike know, this genre commands a similar combination of entertainment, competition, and passion.

165
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,100
Thanks for watching, and
we’ll see you next...blank

166
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,460
