00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash
Course Games.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,260
As you’ll remember from last time, by the mid-90s, Nintendo and Sega were in the midst of a war for console dominance,

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,140
and their struggle to outdo each other were driving improvements in hardware, games, and all around user experience.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,980
The video game industry was worth around
$19 billion in 1993,

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,720
and that kind of money is likely to attract the attention of an even bigger company than Sega and Nintendo.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,540
Enter Sony, a pretty well-known Japanese electronics company that had like $36 billion in total revenue in 1993.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,780
Sony was about to enter the console market
with the Playstation.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,460
And that unassuming gray box was about to
disrupt pretty much everything in home consoles.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:47,360
[Theme Music]

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,740
So, the second round of the console war between Nintendo and SEGA was still in full swing in 1994, and we’ll get to Sony’s role in a bit,

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:01,180
but I just want to point out that there were some other consoles that tried to take part in the console war but just didn’t get in there.

12
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,619
Sorry Turbografx-16.
And remember Atari? They tried too.

13
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,210
They made their last stand in the console
market in 1993 with the Jaguar,

14
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,030
an attempt to take a technological leap past
their competition.

15
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,030
The Atari Jaguar was technically a 32 bit
system, but it had two significant problems.

16
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,780
It was really difficult for programmers to
write games for it,

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,820
and it had this totally bizarre controller
design with a numeric keypad.

18
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,700
You can almost hear the Intellivision and Colecovision controllers looking at it and going "really?"

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,180
Very few developers made games for the Jaguar, and few people wanted to play the games that did get made.

20
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,660
Which wasn’t great for sales.

21
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,590
Now, processing power wasn’t the only technology
game companies were pushing forward.

22
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,300
Most of the industry was looking toward the relatively new data storage format, compact discs.

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,220
They might seem quaint now, in the age of streaming and the death of physical media and all,

24
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,640
but in the 1990s, CDs were AMAZING.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,240
And these plastic compact discs could hold a lot more data than a game cartridge. I mean, A LOT more.

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,220
For example, the standard Sega cartridge held
somewhere between 4 and 5 megabytes of data.

27
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,429
A CD-ROM could hold over 700 megabytes.
And they had LASERS!

28
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:08,560
Sega was first to market with a 1992 North American release of their SegaCD add-on for the Genesis,

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,580
and their rush to get it released showed.

30
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,709
It was criticized for its high price, its
lack of quality games,

31
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:19,620
and the fact that the new massive storage capacity was mostly just used to add grainy video sequences, rather than improving gameplay.

32
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,540
But don’t blame Sonic CD for that, OK?

33
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Sonic CD was cool.
Gave us Metal Sonic.

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,450
Despite the problems with the SegaCD, the
company tried again to make a technological

35
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,980
leap without introducing a new console in
1994, when they launched the 32x add-on.

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,180
It was an attempt to be the first to market
with 32 bit processing,

37
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,650
but the 32x faced a lot of the same criticisms
the SegaCD had.

38
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,280
Poor games, a high price, and a sense that
the peripheral really didn’t add much to

39
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,430
the experience made the 32x a commercial failure.

40
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,650
The SegaCD and the 32x foreshadowed Sega’s
hardware struggles in the industry.

41
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,870
But Sega had a pretty good reason to rush
these products to market.

42
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,640
As we mentioned earlier, the consumer electronics giant, Sony, was about to enter the video game market,

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,380
and Sega was correctly worried that this would
weaken their sales.

44
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,200
Sony had been in the background of the game
industry for a few years,

45
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,140
and had tentatively partnered with Nintendo in 1998 to help develop a CD-ROM peripheral for the SNES.

46
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,700
That drive was never released,

47
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,019
and the two companies had a big fight about
Nintendo flirting with Sony’s competition Philips,

48
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,359
and they had a terrible breakup, and Sony
said,

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,960
“Fine. We’ll go make our own CD based
video game console,

50
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,599
and it’ll be better than any console you
ever made, NINTENDO!”

51
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,639
And that’s just what they did.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

52
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,799
In 1994, Sony debuted their 32-bit PlayStation.

53
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,849
Prior to launch, Sony developed strong relationships
with third-party developers like Namco and

54
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,489
Konami to ensure the console would have great
games.

55
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,820
Their design featured technological innovations which were miles ahead of Sega and Nintendo’s consoles.

56
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,719
The CD-ROM drive was essential to the console’s
success.

57
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:44,879
The CD-ROMS weren’t quite as fast as the
flash memory-based cartridges,

58
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,040
but their massively increased storage capacity gave developers the space to combine detailed pre-rendered backgrounds

59
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,760
with polygon-based foreground graphics to create immersive experiences unlike anything gamers had seen on a console.

60
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,740
But the downside of the move to CD storage
was in transfer speeds.

61
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,319
These early CD drives were considerably slower
than cartridge-based games,

62
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,199
and it could take a long time for a large
level of a game to load into the system memory.

63
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,440
This was the birth of the...load screen.

64
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,120
The Playstation also emphasized the then-new
technology of polygon-based 3D graphics.

65
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,660
These powerful graphics processors allowed
developers to create worlds with depth,

66
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,760
and at their best gave players the opportunity to look around and see a sort of fully realized world.

67
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,960
These blocky characters made of thousands of triangles might look clunky and primitive to us now,

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,360
but at the time,
they were revolutionary.

69
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,380
Watching the perspective of the game change
as the in-game camera spun around your character

70
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,580
was an unusual and exciting experience for
players in the 90s.

71
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,740
A smaller innovation, both in terms of size and impact on the industry, was the memory card.

72
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,370
The Playstation didn’t have internal storage
to save games.

73
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,990
Instead it used a small memory card, which
allowed players to save their progress,

74
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,230
but also made those saved games portable.

75
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,300
Want to show your friend how far you’ve
gotten in Tomb Raider?

76
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,090
You could take your saved game with you when
you went to your friend’s house.

77
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,260
Thanks Thought Bubble.

78
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,060
These technical advantages allowed the Playstation to quickly take the lead in a market full of outdated consoles,

79
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,880
but Sega and Nintendo didn’t stand still.

80
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,860
Sega released it’s 32-bit Saturn console
in 1995.

81
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,180
It’s beautiful isn’t it.

82
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,120
But it didn’t manage to recapture much market
share from Sony.

83
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,910
The console mainly suffered from a lack of
compelling games.

84
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,950
Sega rushed a product to market again, and
they failed again.

85
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,110
Third-party game developers were reluctant
to make games for the system.

86
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,000
Sega wasn’t even able to launch a game with its most popular character, Sonic, on the console.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The Saturn failed to catch on with the gaming
public, and was discontinued by 1998.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,300
Nintendo’s answer to the Playstation and
the Saturn was to step back, take a breath,

89
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,300
skip the whole 32-bit thing, and get a head start on the next generation of consoles.

90
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,650
The Nintendo 64 was launched in 1996, and
was an immediate hit.

91
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,380
As you might have guessed from the name, the
console came loaded with a 64-bit processor.

92
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,920
The system was also widely praised for its controller design which included a control stick.

93
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,820
Now, although it was technically digital and
not an analog stick,

94
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,630
it had varying levels of movement and nearly
360-degree control.

95
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,220
You still had the d-pad like most game controllers,
but you were limited to those 8 directions.

96
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,760
Whereas with the control stick you allowed
for much more nuanced movement.

97
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,730
Which was ideal for 3D rendered worlds that
were everywhere in the 90s.

98
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,200
And the N64 capitalized on these great controllers

99
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,770
by also being the first mass-market console
with four built in controller ports.

100
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,500
This not only differentiated the console from
the other options,

101
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,310
it foreshadowed a focus on multiplayer, social
games that would be some of its bestsellers.

102
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,740
The N64 was also the last major console to
deliver games on cartridges.

103
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,840
While cartridges allowed for blazing fast data transfers, and avoided those load screens no one likes,

104
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
they did introduce limitations for developers.

105
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,820
Those storage capacities we talked about before became an increasing concern for these larger and larger games.

106
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,000
Also, cartridges were also much more expensive
to manufacture,

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,600
meaning a game that didn’t sell was a much bigger loss for a company if that game was on a cartridge vs a CD-ROM.

108
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,540
But these consoles weren’t successful just
because they had the latest technology.

109
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,900
Sega Saturn and Atari Jaguar had that as well.

110
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,760
Advanced hardware can only do so much to help sell a console, but great games can do the trick.

111
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,940
The Playstation and the N64 dominated the
market in the late 1990s

112
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,490
because they used these technological advances
to deliver great gaming experiences.

113
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,990
Nintendo understood how to harness the potential
of 3D immediately.

114
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,700
Super Mario 64 featured a huge world that
was entirely polygon based.

115
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,280
The game featured a flying camera system that
followed the player around the world,

116
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,660
but also allowed players to take control and explore scenes by swiveling the camera around.

117
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:25,040
Another huge Nintendo 64 hit was GoldenEye 007, a first person shooter based in the James Bond universe.

118
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,960
And unlike the movie it was based on, the game was met with pretty universal acclaim from critics and from players.

119
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,720
It would go on to sell 8 million copies.

120
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,520
GoldenEye 007 was praised for well-crafted single player missions, as well as its local multiplayer deathmatch mode.

121
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,760
The game leveraged the n64’s four controller
ports to host four player combat,

122
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,860
and as it turned out, players really liked
shooting each other in video games.

123
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,100
The four N64 controller ports allowed Nintendo to focus on making video games that you could play in groups,

124
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,340
such as four player races in Mario Kart 64
and Diddy Kong Racing,

125
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,420
4 player minigames in the Mario Party series,
or 4-player fights in Super Smash Brothers.

126
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,240
But even all this couldn’t keep up with
the Playstation’s success.

127
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,980
Sony’s close relationships with developers led to many excellent and innovative games appearing on its system.

128
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,520
Games like Tomb Raider.

129
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,360
Tomb Raider was released on Playstation in 1996 and became one of the most iconic games of the era.

130
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,940
The game was met with praise for its huge,
richly detailed world,

131
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,520
and its innovative level designs that pushed
the boundaries of adventure platform games.

132
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,880
The game’s lead character Lara Croft was
an instant celebrity,

133
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,660
and Tomb Raider even had success outside of
video games.

134
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,520
The franchise spread out into movies,

135
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,460
and Lara appeared on the covers of magazines
that were normally about real people.

136
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,409
She even made an appearance on U2’s PopMart
Tour.

137
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,909
But Tomb Raider has also met with a lot of
criticism,

138
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,800
much of it centered around Lara Crofts unrealistic body proportions, and the sexualization of her character.

139
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,440
Although, some of the concerns about Lara and unrealistic body images have been addressed in later versions of the game.

140
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,100
All of this points to the unprecedented level of immersion and connection that 1990s games introduced to the market.

141
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,960
These more-realistic-than-ever characters
and following them in their game worlds,

142
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,589
as well as in real life, allowed players to
connect with them like never before.

143
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:04,509
In addition to characters, the advances in the industry also increased the ways players connected with games through improved storytelling.

144
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:10,000
And there was no better example of the massive narratives that could unfold on the new consoles than Final Fantasy 7.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,579
This role playing game was so huge, it was
delivered on three discs.

146
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:16,980
The world of Final Fantasy 7 was open-ended
and players could choose their path.

147
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,040
While the game has a linear story, there were also many optional side quests for the players to take.

148
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,400
The Materia system allowed players to adjust
and alter their abilities.

149
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,460
And the massive storage capacity of CDs meant developers could include lots of full motion video cut scenes,

150
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,700
and include a lot of story to go with all
that gameplay.

151
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,260
And there was a lot of gameplay.

152
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,400
Players could literally spend hundreds of
hours in the game,

153
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,340
trying to complete the many quests and collect
all the items and spells.

154
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,760
Final Fantasy 7 was also successfully ported
to personal computers,

155
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,520
and oh man, we haven’t even talked about
PC gaming yet!

156
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,280
Home computers were also becoming more powerful,

157
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,699
and the games that were available for them
were improving as well.

158
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:53,139
There were ports of console games like Tomb
Raider and Final Fantasy VII,

159
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:56,659
but there were several games and genres that
were at their best in their PC versions.

160
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,140
First person shooters flourished in the PC
space.

161
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,420
Games like Quake and Duke Nukem capitalized
on the success of Doom,

162
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,279
and delivered ever more harrowing experiences
to PC players.

163
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,779
But, even the FPS scene able to add compelling
storytelling.

164
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,720
There were franchises like Half-Life that were successful at integrating gripping stories into FPS action.

165
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,740
And as we got to the end of the 1990s, Sega
tried one more entry into the console market.

166
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:25,820
On 9/9/1999, Sega released the dreamcast, which was powerful, innovative, and launched with great games.

167
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,680
In addition to raw processing power, the Dreamcast
featured a modem for online multiplayer games,

168
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:32,509
played on this new thing called the Internets.

169
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:35,709
And it also had a cool controller that had
an optional display.

170
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:40,540
And it had lots of really good games, and
lots of really weird games. Like Seaman.

171
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,149
But even with its Sonic Adventures, its Jet
Set Radios, and its Marvels vs Capcoms,

172
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:49,509
the Dreamcast didn’t take off and ended
up being Sega’s final home console.

173
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:52,980
The company changed its business model to
become a game development company only,

174
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,720
and Nintendo and Sony were the only two consoles
left standing.

175
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,100
But, the market wouldn’t stay uncrowded
for long.

176
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,180
Next time, we’re going to discuss the arrival a new home console from a company that rivals even the megacorp that is Sony.

177
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,360
A company that pushed the technological and
storytelling aspects of the medium even further.

178
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,360
That’s right, we’re talking about a little company called Microsoft. We’ll see you next time.

179
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,940
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and
Stacey Emigholz studio in Indianpolis, Indiana.

180
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,509
And it's made with the help of all of these
nice people.

181
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:23,999
