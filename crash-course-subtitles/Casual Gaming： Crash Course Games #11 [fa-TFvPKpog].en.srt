00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Hi, I'm AndrÃ© Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,820
So we ended the last episode with more connected consoles

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,760
and we'll see improved specs and deeper integration in these platforms throughout the next decade.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,880
But today we're going to take a look at the larger cultural shifts that were happening in gaming.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,920
As we've seen, gaming constantly evolves with new technologies, just like Pokemon.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,360
And over the last decade, there has been an explosion of technologies

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,240
that have allowed games to infiltrate all areas of our lives.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,320
We now have games on our phones, in our schools, basically anywhere we have an internet connection.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,740
Many of us walk around with a library of games at our literal fingertips.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,240
These games have challenged
the industry that spawns them.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,600
Players are no longer tied to the table
or to the TV to play games.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,180
Today, we're going to talk about social and mobile gaming and how they have led to a shift towards casual gaming.

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,960
So pull up your phone and your tablet, log into your favorite social network, and let's explore what gaming has done to link us all together.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,840
[Theme Music]

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,480
With 1.09 billion daily active users as of March 2016,

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,700
Facebook and other social networks have become one of the premier places for people to connect with others.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,940
And just like real life gathering places, these social networks eventually became a shared space for play.

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:18,920
Now, many games can be called "social", but the social games we're going to be talking about today have a few distinct, though rapidly changing, standards.

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,460
Currently, social games are games that primarily take place over an online social network,

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,020
usually accessed via a computer or other device like the kind of games you find on Facebook.

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,860
Social games almost always involve users' social contacts as part of gameplay.

22
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,900
They require socialisation activities like trading and they often don't demand synchronous gameplay.

23
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,140
That is, players don't necessarily have to be playing the game at the same time to participate.

24
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,120
Typically, these games also don't have a true ending or victory but instead encourage perpetual play.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,020
But any game that relies on a network of users to operate can be a social game.

26
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,940
So games that have their own smaller, contained networks within apps could be considered social games too, like those on your mobile phone.

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,280
Now, social games can be mobile games, but not all mobile games are social games.

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,540
Technically, mobile games are found on phones, tablets, and other mobile devices like smart watches.

29
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,440
Usually, they are more intricate than social games, but more limited in scope than larger PC or console games.

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,180
They sometimes use infrared, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth to connect players

31
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,720
and mobile games generally rely on touch screen technology for all major interactions as opposed to controllers used for console games.

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,260
According to the Entertainment Software Association, as of 2014, roughly 30% of mobile games are social games.

33
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,340
Combined, mobile and social games are a form of casual gaming, which refers to the actual duration of gameplay.

34
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,620
Unlike console games that typically require up to 50+ hours to complete in sustained multi-hour sessions

35
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,500
casual games only require a few minutes of sustained play to finish a mission, collect an item, or tidy up the game space.

36
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,000
Sure, players can play casual games for a much longer total time if they often lack definitive endings, particularly in social games.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,920
But often these games are even designed to force smaller bouts of play with timed events.

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,420
Like in Candy Crush, when you only get a limited number of times to play before you have to come back and play again.

39
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,100
Or in Smurf Village -- you build a house, but you gotta wait for an hour before it's done.

40
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,900
Timed events force players to wait to play and come back to play.

41
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,860
However, they alternatively encourage the player to continue playing by paying a fee or promoting the game to a friend.

42
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,020
We'll get into that in a little bit.

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,400
But not all casual games are mobile games.

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,620
With the introduction of many shorter indie game titles and party games found on consoles like Nintendo Wii

45
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,360
the casual gaming market was showing up more and more in home consoles

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,600
and the definition of casual gaming starts to get a little blurry.

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,240
But is the point is, casual games have become an integral part of gaming culture.

48
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:40,660
Since 2010, social gaming alone has seen a 71% increase, with an estimated 510 million people playing online.

49
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,560
81 million of those people log in and play at least once a day

50
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,020
and 49 million of them play multiple times throughout the day.

51
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:54,520
And casual games have become one of the fastest growing game genres. As of 2016, mobile and social games held nearly half of the video game market.

52
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,380
So how did social games become so popular?

53
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,360
Well, Facebook launched in 2004 with no games whatsoever

54
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,940
and it wasn't until 2009 that they began to pop up on the site and notifications popped up in your inbox.

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,800
Early games like Happy Farm, Farm Town, and Barn Buddy were heralds for what was to come

56
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,060
and I think you may know what game we're going to talk about next.

57
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,560
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,080
The company Zynga created a social gaming phenomenon with Farmville.

59
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,880
This simple game of raising animals and harvesting crops with the help of your friends

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,120
rapidly grew to over 10 million players within six weeks of its debut

61
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,420
and within a year, that number had risen to 80 million players.

62
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,860
Farmville capitalised on its social component by encouraging users to contact their Facebook friends

63
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,520
to help as farm hands to complete tasks more quickly

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,380
and it also rewarded players with in-game currency for helping out other players.

65
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,800
Although this message spamming was
exasperating to many non-players,

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,180
Zynga claims Farmville has lead to 752,000 players' first dates and 280,000 marriage proposals.

67
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,700
Time to change your relationship status!

68
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,580
Farmville's success helped launch
the popularity of social games,

69
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,300
and companies were quick to mimic it with games like Mafia Wars, Cityville, and Island Paradise.

70
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,960
These games helped popularise the free-to-play model that was introduced in the MMOs of the late 90s.

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,140
Free-to-play games don't cost anything to get the software and play.

72
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:12,860
They relied on ads for revenue and often used in-game currency that could be purchased through, that's right, micro-transactions.

73
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,120
Players tend to spend more money over time with micro-transactions than with subscription fees

74
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,700
but the majority of players never spend anything at all.

75
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,380
The vast majority of revenue for social games comes from die-hard players

76
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,020
(sometimes referred to, hopefully affectionately, as whales)

77
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,480
but the rest of the players do have value, as their numbers are used to set ad rates for in-game advertising.

78
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,680
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

79
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,760
So games like Farmville were, of course, profitable, but they also provided a social component unlike many other games of the time.

80
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,100
Social games encouraged shared interaction to complete challenges, chat windows for communication,

81
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,260
and, of course, real opponents or teammates for less predictable and more engaging gameplay.

82
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,800
Social games are also composed of a player's community of "friends"

83
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,700
and tend to have much simpler gaming mechanics which encourage much broader participation.

84
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,100
That's why your grandma keeps sending you those Farmville requests.

85
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,400
While social games are getting popular on Facebook, mobile games are getting popular on our iPhones and Androids.

86
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,040
Nearly 85% of the mobile app market revenue in 2015 was from games.

87
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,180
That's about $35 billion.

88
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,320
And these mobile games carried many social gaming principals with them.

89
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,580
For example, in 2009, a feathered flock of angered avians descended from their perches onto the world of gaming.

90
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,260
One of the most popular games of the mobile genre, Rovio's Angry Birds, became another modern gaming phenomenon.

91
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,280
Angry Birds was an instant hit.

92
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:34,020
As of 2015, there were over 3 billion downloads of some version or special edition of Angry Birds across all known platforms.

93
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:42,240
The mobile battalions, the toys, board games, Star Wars, Transformers, a feature film, and multiple theme parks -- Angry Birds has become a main-stay in popular culture.

94
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,540
And this is no accident.

95
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,340
Rovio claims that there were many previously failed mobile games

96
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,160
and it learned that people need to be able to play the game right away and in short bursts.

97
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,040
Players wanted a game they could easily pick up and put down, basically what now defines a casual game.

98
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,160
Angry Birds also offered the free-to-play model we talked about with social games

99
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,040
and allowed players the opportunity to unlock extra features for a price.

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,700
Again with the micro-transactions.

101
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,960
And interestingly, in 2012, Rovio released Angry Birds on Facebook, integrating more social components within the game

102
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,120
such as in-game purchases and the ability for players to compete in tournaments among friends

103
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,160
further muddying the line between social and mobile gaming.

104
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:24,840
So games like Farmville, Candy Crush, and Panda Pop -- I hadn't even heard of Panda Pop -- have become an integral part of many players' daily lives.

105
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,440
But why are these games so popular?

106
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,120
Of course, there is the social component of playing games with friends.

107
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,360
Also, the simple mechanics have encouraged much broader adoption

108
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,580
and mobile games do tap into some psychological principles found in addictions.

109
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,720
These short games allow for succinct positive feedback for the player.

110
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,980
An easy win makes us feel great and urges us to repeat the action.

111
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,260
A loss in, particularly, a game that looks like an easy win makes us feel angry and urges us to repeat the action.

112
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,060
This was evident in games like Flappy Bird.

113
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,200
If you remember, in February 2014, the creator of Flappy Bird removed his app from the Apple and Android stores

114
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,380
because he thought the game was too addictive.

115
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,800
And then people made clones of it.
And I'm still addicted.

116
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,280
According to Mark Griffiths, the director of the International Gaming Research Unit in Nottingham Trent University,

117
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,620
mobile games are, in many ways, like slot machines.

118
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,740
When they become predictable, they become boring

119
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,740
but if they are random, but still possible to win, they encourage persistence of play.

120
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,240
And there's a lot more we could say about the psychology of why we play games but we'll get into that in a future episode.

121
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,580
So, as you can see, gaming continues to follow us through our latest technologies

122
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,520
and with the introduction of casual gaming through mobile and social games, more and more people are playing games

123
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,720
and gaming itself as a genre is getting hard to define.

124
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,620
It's no longer limited to just arcades, consoles, and computers -- gaming is now everywhere we go,

125
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,080
making it part of our regular social interactions and prevalent in our daily lives.

126
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,020
But as you PC gamers know, casual gaming isn't the only place where communities were forming around games.

127
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,720
Next week, we're going to talk about MMORPGs and the communities that have formed around these players.

128
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,480
And with that, I'll let you get back to your game of Candy Crush, Monster Legends and Cross Road.

129
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,760
Thanks for watching, see you next time.

130
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,580
Ooh, 500 gems for $4.99!

131
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,340
Purchase...

132
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,780
Don't judge me.

133
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,080
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

134
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,800
and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

135
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,680
If you'd like to keep Crash Course free for everyone forever

136
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,380
