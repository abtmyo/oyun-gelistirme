00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:06,220
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows, this is Crash Course Games, and today, we’re totally talking about the 1980s.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,840
Like for sure. Gag me with a spoon. The 80s were kind of a big deal when it comes to video games.

3
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,190
And hairspray. And breakdancing.
But this show is about games.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,690
In the 1980s video games really became a big
business,

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,720
as arcades and home systems became more of
a worldwide cultural thing.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,830
But it’s not all good news, high scores
and buckets of beautiful, shiny quarters.

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,020
There’s some tragedy, too. In the 1980s, the video game industry had a Boom, but then it had a Bust.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:42,660
[Theme Music]

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,580
Let’s start with the Boom.

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,600
In the early 1980’s Atari, Coleco, Mattel they were selling a lot of video games and consoles.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,960
It was kind of a golden age of gaming.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,280
By 1982 there were an estimated 24,000 arcades
and 1.5 million arcade cabinets in the US.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:08,000
A 1981 Time article reported 20 billion quarters were going into these machines to buy 75,000 hours of playtime.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,640
Video weren’t toys and hobbies anymore.
They were popular culture.

15
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:15,729
They were on TV, they were in magazines, and
in movies like War Games and Tron.

16
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,640
While there were a lot of arcade and console
games being produced in the early 80’s,

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,240
a few huge, influential hits dominated the arcades, and informed the game design of the day.

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,400
Like this guy right here, Pac-Man waka waka
waka waka.

19
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,179
Namco’s Pac-Man, who was called Puck-Man in his home country of Japan, was designed by Toru Iwatani.

20
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:36,990
And if you want to know why they changed it
from Puck-Man to Pac-Man when it came to America,

21
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,050
uh, watch Scott Pilgrim Vs The World - has
a whole scene that explains it.

22
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,940
Anyway, Pac-Man with his power pellets and
ghost monsters

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,649
went onto become the first video game character
with a TV show.

24
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:47,359
I used to watch the Pac-Man cartoon.

25
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,090
He even had toys, lunch boxes, all that merchandise
stuff.

26
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,669
This expanded the ways games could earn revenue.

27
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:58,259
Pac-Man also revolutionized game design with the addition of the world’s first video game cutscenes,

28
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,859
which were place to give players’ wrists a break and to advance the story, although it wasn’t a very deep story.

29
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:09,859
Although I did like that part where Pac-Man
goes off screen and he comes back really big!

30
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,840
A sequel to Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man was another
huge hit,

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,060
and Ms. Pac-Man was the first female protagonist
in a game.

32
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,480
The game built on a lot of what made it’s
predecessor so popular.

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,600
The game improved the play from Pac-Man, and improved on the cut scenes of the original, including a love story.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,100
Act 1: they meet. Act 2: the chase. Act 3: Jr.

35
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,940
Jr Pac-Man of course got his own game too.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,860
There were so many awesome arcade games of
the 80s,

37
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,790
Q*bert, that’s my personal favorite, Frogger,
Burger Time, Joust.

38
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:45,950
But the biggest of the big 1980s games was the tale of barrel throwing, girl-friend kidnapping ape

39
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,780
by the name of Donkey Kong,
created by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto,

40
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,440
who would later create Mario, Link, and Pikmin.

41
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,090
Miyamoto chose the name Donkey to convey the
idea of stubbornness,

42
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,799
and added the Kong of course to evoke famous
giant ape movie star, King Kong...Donkey Kong!

43
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:04,939
The game was the classic tale of a carpenter/woman/gorilla love triangle.

44
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:08,849
It was hard to play, but it was fun to play
and it was a massive hit.

45
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:16,360
Nintendo sold 60,000 cabinets and made $180 million on Donkey Kong by the middle of 1982.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,780
Donkey Kong and other games of the early 1980’s
also saw the birth of competitive video gaming,

47
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,320
which would have an enduring effect on the
industry. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,700
As video games became a fixture of pop culture,
elite players began to emerge,

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,900
so it was only natural that they’d start
to compete.

50
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,040
Contests and high-score competitions became
common,

51
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,829
and they weren’t just for the stereotypical
teen boy video gamer.

52
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:40,519
For example, Doris Self set the Q*Bert world
record in 1984

53
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,739
at the Twin Galaxies Video Game Masters Tournament
at the age of 58.

54
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,040
But this kind of marathon play wasn’t what
game designers originally had in mind.

55
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,489
Games like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong were intended
to give players a few minutes of play time,

56
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,819
and then make them pay another quarter to
play again.

57
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,889
Elite players’ skills allowed them to play
games all the way to the end.

58
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:01,139
It was something designers hadn’t planned
for.

59
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,040
Many of the most popular games didn’t even
have endings.

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,660
The programming would just eventually break,
in what players called a kill screen.

61
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,700
Pac-man for example, famously broke on level 256, thanks to a limitation to the 8 bit memory space.

62
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,160
In Donkey Kong, players could go as far as
level 117,

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,250
at which point the game randomly killed poor
Jumpman, aka Mario off,

64
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,030
leaving his quest to save Pauline tragically
incomplete.

65
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,340
Players at home were also becoming more skilfull,

66
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,280
and wanted a stronger feeling of achievement
from their gameplay.

67
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
So companies like Activision responded by
rewarding players with real world prizes.

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,500
Players who mailed in a picture of a high score from an Activision game were mailed an embroidered patch.

69
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,699
Players would then sew these onto their clothing
and show off their skills.

70
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,970
Being good at video games had literally become
a badge of honor.

71
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,490
These achievements weren’t just about making
players feel good though.

72
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,830
They were also a powerful marketing tool.

73
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,340
Competitive gaming and the bragging rights
that came with high scores

74
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,460
were an important part of creating a culture around gaming, and they also drove a lot of sales.

75
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,160
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So it’s cool to
see all these competitive and elite gamers,

76
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,960
but increasingly sophisticated players meant that games needed to become more sophisticated and interesting as well.

77
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,740
That meant the 1980’s also saw huge leaps
in terms of game design.

78
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,220
Take for example Defender by Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar, is recognized as one of the first “hard-core” games.

79
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,479
Many employees at Williams, the company behind
the game, thought it was too difficult,

80
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,580
but the designers wrote the game so that even the most skilled player couldn’t break it by being too good.

81
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,980
But Defender’s difficulty didn’t hurt
its sales. It may have even enhanced them.

82
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,000
It sold over 55,000 cabinets, and according
to GameSpy magazine, the game earned over

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,380
a billion dollars by 2001.

84
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,360
It seemed like gamers wanted challenging games.
And Defender was also technically innovative.

85
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,430
It was one of the first scrolling shooter
games, and it introduced the idea of a minimap.

86
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,660
Then of course there was Centipede.
You all remember Centipede.

87
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,520
Centipede would come down, you would roll that trackball around and the ship would move. Pew. Pew.

88
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,020
Centipede was created by Ed Logg and Dona
Bailey,

89
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,740
who was one of the few women among early video
game programmers.

90
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,520
Dona Bailey said, "I really wanted it to look different, to be visually arresting." And visually arresting it was.

91
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,310
Not only was Centipede a popular game, but
it had a significant female audience.

92
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,220
Gaming in the 80s was becoming more of a universally
accepted form of entertainment for everyone.

93
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,430
E for everyone.
Oh wait that's… that’s later.

94
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,840
So, game designers were innovating to capture
different markets in the arcades,

95
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,099
but they were also beginning to recognize
and design for the very different experience

96
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:21,330
of playing games on a home console.

97
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,509
In the early days of console gaming, most of the titles available were ports of arcade hits

98
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:28,370
that attempted to recreate an arcade experience
at home.

99
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,740
Activision’s Pitfall was not one of those
games.

100
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,780
It was released on the Atari 2600, and was
designed as a longer, more complex experience.

101
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,540
The game was written to last 20 minutes, which was much, much longer than other games of the time.

102
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,699
Pitfall changed the pace of games.

103
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,000
It established the home console market as a place for games people spent significant time with,

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,900
and connected with in a way that was difficult
than with an arcade game.

105
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,500
So this is where we get to the Bust,

106
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,320
which some people call “The Great North
American Video Game Crash of 1983.”

107
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,139
But, we’re going to continue to call it
the Bust.

108
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,759
The early 1980s were a time of innovation
and growth in the video game industry,

109
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,800
but those years were also pretty unstable.

110
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,840
Lots of emerging industries experience a sort of “wild west” situation in their early years.

111
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,040
Think back to the thrilling early years of
the washing machine industry.

112
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,189
What is that, even? Video games were no different.

113
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:17,680
Video games were popular, and they were new,
and not everyone understood them very well.

114
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,199
It seemed like a sector where easy profit could be had, and lots of companies wanted to get into the market.

115
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,099
The problem is, small companies didn’t have
the resources to create quality games,

116
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,580
so they started cranking out terrible products,
and large brands tried to jump on the bandwagon

117
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,800
with some really terrible games that blurred
the line between games and marketing.

118
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,140
Quaker Oats bought a video game division. Quaker Oats. You make oats, Quaker. Not video games.

119
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,740
And brands that had no connection to video games commissioned terrible, terrible games just to promote their products.

120
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,920
Aficionados of Purina’s Chuck Wagon brand could send in proofs of purchase to get this beauty, Catch the Chuck Wagon.

121
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,940
I’m not sure who this game was for, as most of Chuck Wagon’s most loyal customers are dogs.

122
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,580
And not only did consoles have to compete
against each other,

123
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,680
they also had to compete against home computers
like the Apple II or Commodore 64 here.

124
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,660
You see video game consoles had one function,
entertainment, but computers were multi-functional.

125
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,200
So that was their selling point.

126
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,500
We could be your word processor.
We could be your spreadsheets.

127
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,389
And also we can play video games.
That further crowded the market.

128
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:21,319
So all those consoles plus home computers
contributed to the sense that there were just

129
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,280
too many systems to choose from.

130
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,040
For example, Frogger could be played on 8 different home systems, in addition to the arcade options.

131
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,140
Atari, the industry’s biggest player wanted to retain market share in the face of all this competition,

132
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,120
and their solution was to rush games through
development.

133
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,800
That was not a good solution.

134
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,160
Games that should have taken 6 months to create
were instead created and released in 6 weeks.

135
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,400
The home version of Pac-Man was so bad that the public returned the cartridges back to stores.

136
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,940
Pac-Man - one of the most popular video game
characters of the 80s.

137
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,780
In 1983, Atari lost nearly $500 million,
and was bleeding around $2 million a day.

138
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,860
The company cut its workforce from 10,000
employees to 400.

139
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,500
And this leads us to the quintessential bad
game of the Bust.

140
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,560
A movie license of Spielberg’s E.T., the
Extraterrestrial.

141
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,320
Atari paid $21 million for the rights, but only spent 5 weeks making the game, and it was terrible.

142
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,300
It’s been accurately called one of the worst
games of all time,

143
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,820
and many people even blame it specifically
for the video game bust.

144
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,370
The public was starting to lose confidence
in the gaming industry.

145
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,860
5 million copies of E.T. were manufactured,
but only 1 million sold.

146
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,270
The rest of the cartridges wound up buried
in a landfill near Alamogordo, New Mexico.

147
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,850
The Great Crash was sort of like the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event,

148
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,540
except there was no giant meteor hitting the
Earth - instead really bad games hitting consoles.

149
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,230
The ColecoVision, Intellivision, Odyssey systems
all disappeared.

150
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,200
While the video game industry was devastated by the crash, a few companies did survive the carnage.

151
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,900
In the late 1980s, one of those survivors
from Japan, the Nintendo Corporation, would

152
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,920
rise to dominate the industry.

153
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,800
Nintendo did this by correcting many of the
mistakes of the gaming industry’s past.

154
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,840
Nintendo’s consistent focus on quality and player experience would take the company to the forefront of the industry.

155
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,000
But we’ll talk about that next week.

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,760
Oh yeah, Nintendo’s getting its own episode!

157
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,620
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and
Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

158
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,920
and it’s made with the help of all these
nice people.

159
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,300
