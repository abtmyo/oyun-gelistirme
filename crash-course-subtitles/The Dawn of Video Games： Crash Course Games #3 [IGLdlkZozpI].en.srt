00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Hi, I'm Andre Meadows, and this is Crash Course Games.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,480
Today we're going to start talking about the twentieth century, and the advent of computer games.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,020
But before we get into that,
let's start with a little perspective.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,840
Computers are, historically speaking anyway,
very new, and they've evolved very quickly.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,840
These days, if you have a mobile device on your person, you probably have more technology with you

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,840
than NASA had when they went to the moon!

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,740
And yes, I know that's kind of a clichÃ©, but it's true.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,820
The Apollo Guidance Computer had a processing speed of 1 megahertz, and it only had 4 kilobytes of memory!

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,960
That means it could only hold 2048 programmed words.
Better choose those wisely.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,860
Meanwhile, an iPhone 4S has a processing speed of 800 megahertz, and a minimum memory of 16 gigabytes!

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,840
Though, to be fair, an iPhone isn't going
to get you to the moon.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,280
At least not yet. Tim Cook's got
something going, I'm pretty sure.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,300
But you won't get a signal there. Trust me.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:02,060
[Theme Music]

15
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,900
Historically, computers, and the games that were created for computers, are a new phenomenon,

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,180
seeing as electronic computers appeared in the 1940s.

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,840
And those early computers? They were some serious tools.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,580
Colossus, not to be confused with Colossus from X-Men and Deadpool,

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,360
was built during World War II to break Nazi codes.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,260
And ENIAC, which is considered the first computer to be reprogrammable, it was primarily used for calculating artillery tables,

21
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,360
that helped soldiers drop explosives on each other more accurately.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,520
But human beings have a long rich history of turning serious tools into playthings and games.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,600
Pretty much as soon as we humans invent something useful, we turn it into a game. We're fun!

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,560
Spears get turned into javelins. Auto racing was invented pretty much as soon as we had cars.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,120
We even turned dating into game shows and mobile apps! Swipe left! Swipe right! Super like!

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,400
So it seems pretty natural that computer games were invented as soon as we had computers.

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,900
Now those computer games weren't like the games we have today.

28
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,280
They weren't consoles or home computers, because there were like, ten computers.

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,280
And they all belonged to the army or universities, and they all cost a lot of money.

30
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,120
But some pioneers were creating video games, or electronic computer games, as they were called.

31
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:16,080
Now video games, in their most basic sense, involve a game played on a computer device and projected onto some kind of video screen.

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,380
The precursors to video games were computer games, that were made on giant early computers to test the machines.

33
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,960
And before those there were electronic games,

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,700
or those games made on electronic devices without a screen or a computer running the program.

35
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,600
And now that we've made that distinction,

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,040
let's just agree to call all these electronic and computer games "video games."

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,900
Because it'll make this stuff a lot easier for me to say.

38
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,740
We're going to start with a device known as the "Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device."

39
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,180
It sounds dirty, but it's not.

40
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,860
In 1947, right after WWII, Thomas T. Goldsmith, professor of Physics and

41
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,340
television pioneer, and his co-worker Estle Ray Mann filed for, and received,

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,560
what is considered the first patent for an electronic game with a video display.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,060
An ancestor of our modern video games.

44
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,740
The game was a series of eight cathode-ray tubes hooked up to an oscilloscope for display,

45
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,040
and with a set of knobs as player controls.

46
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,340
Now, cathode-ray tubes were the technology behind those old, thick, heavy televisions.

47
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,740
They would project a beam of light onto the oscilloscope, and the user would see an arc of light.

48
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,660
The game simulated the firing of artillery shells,

49
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,880
and when the "shell" reached its target, its beam would de-focus, simulating an explosion.

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,180
This gave players a sense that their "missiles" had struck a target and caused damage.

51
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,000
And that was it. The technology could only generate that beam of light,

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,020
so the other part of the game was a screen overlay, which would later be a regular feature of 1970s video games.

53
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,220
While this all sounds very fun, and had virtually unlimited market potential,

54
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,840
The parts that went into the "Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device" cost a lot

55
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,060
of money in 1947, and mass production would have been impractical.

56
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,280
The amusement device was never made for the public.

57
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,060
It's like the rarest video game ever. Even more rare than "Chrono Trigger."

58
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,880
Another gaming first was the display of the NIMROD gaming computer on May 5, 1951

59
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,600
at the Festival of Britain in the "Dome of Discovery".

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,880
The Festival of Britain was sort of like the World's Fair, but just for Britain,

61
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,760
and just like that weirdly specific exposition to celebrate one small island in northern Europe,

62
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,900
the NIMROD had a very specific task.

63
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:24,960
It was one of the world's first gaming computers, designed and built specifically to play an ancient game called "Nim."

64
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,060
Surely you remember NIM from Alain Resnais' 1961 French new wave film "The Last Year At Marienbad"?

65
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,640
No? Then you're not a real gamer. Just kidding!

66
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,600
Actually the game play itself doesn't really matter.
The NIMROD was more of a proof of concept.

67
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,860
As one of the earliest gaming computers that the public could interact with,

68
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,920
it helped show people that computers could be fun, and it inspired future computer scientists and game developers.

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:56,620
Like in 1952, when a University of Cambridge PhD student, A.S. Douglas, developed "OXO", a graphical version of tic-tac-toe.

70
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,300
OXO was important because it was one of the first video games to include artificial intelligence.

71
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,080
Douglas wasn't a game designer, he just wanted to illustrate his thesis on "Interactions Between Human and Computer."

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,820
The computer moves in reaction to the player's moves, and this is the interesting artificial intelligence part,

73
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,180
they were not predetermined, they were made at the computer's discretion.

74
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,620
The computer thought for itself!

75
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,120
[whispering] Skynet begins.

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,760
So far, all of this is pretty high-minded, right?

77
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,140
All these games were made to demonstrate the power of computers or as part of academic research.

78
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,060
Where's the mindless entertainment of "Burger Time"?

79
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,600
Okay kids, "Burger Time" was an arcade game in the 80s - you know what? Look it up.

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,960
There's food in it. Walking hot dogs and eggs, it's cool.

81
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,040
Video games made the jump to pure entertainment in 1958 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory

82
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,180
in Upton New York. WIlliam Higinbotham, who had been a designer of electronic circuits

83
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,540
for the Manhattan Project, was tasked with entertaining students on Visitor Day.

84
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,600
He looked through the lab for stuff that might divert the youth of 1958, with their

85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,940
hula-hoops and chocolate malts... Whatever they were doin' back then...

86
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,780
While he was reading the manual for one of the computers in the lab,

87
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,720
he discovered that it could calculate and visualize ballistic missile trajectories.

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,620
He made the natural, logical leap, and programmed the machine to play a tennis game.

89
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,240
Kids lined up to play the game and Higinbothom had a hit on his hands.

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,160
The important thing to note here, is that Tennis for Two's success grew out of reading an instruction manual.

91
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,180
Come on, read those manuals kids! Technical writers are working hard to make sure you understand all

92
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:29,680
the functions of your mobile device. Have the common decency to read up and become a power user!

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,480
Actually manuals are important, but that's not the point of Tennis for Two.

94
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,980
The game was never commercialized, but it hinted at the potential of games

95
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,420
created solely for the sake of entertainment.

96
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,180
Ah, so a theme is clearly developing in our history of game development.

97
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,540
The people developing these things were nerds. Awesome, awesome nerds.

98
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,640
NERDS!

99
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,720
And these nerds weren't only creating a new world of computers, they were creating a culture,

100
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,400
and a lot of culture that sprung up around these early pioneers is still with us today.

101
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,740
One of the best known examples of a pack of nerds creating computer culture comes

102
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,760
from the Tech Model Railroad Club at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

103
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,520
Let's go to the "Thought Bubble". Founded in 1946, MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club

104
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,860
or "TMRC", was for students who, unsurprisingly, loved model trains,

105
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,140
but on a deeper level, what they were into was technology and figuring out how things worked,

106
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,840
and that sort of curiosity was piqued when computers started to appear in the mid-20th Century,

107
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,700
and the group would roam the campus at night, sneaking into labs, to learn how to use the computers.

108
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,580
The TMRC developed a culture all their own, with jargon and everything.

109
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,660
They described broken equipment as "munged", they called rolling chairs "bunkies",

110
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,740
and, famously, they called practical jokes or impressive feats "hacks", and they called

111
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,300
the people that pulled off those hacks, "hackers". Exactly.

112
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,120
I know what you're thinking, just like the 1995 movie staring Angelina Jolie as Acid Burn.

113
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,680
In 1961, TMRC member Steve Russell, also known as "Slug", set out to make the biggest hack

114
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,380
of all, a game. He combined his love of "B"-grade sci-fi with his knowledge of the group's favorite computer

115
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:08,320
on campus, the Programmable Data Processor 1, or "PDP-1", to create "Space War!"

116
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Yes, the title includes the exclamation mark.

117
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,440
This game involved two ships, the Needle and Wedge, trying to blow each other up while flying

118
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,140
around a gravitational point. The entire club got involved and members all worked to expand and improve it.

119
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:27,460
The game proved to be so successful that it became part of the PDP-1 operating system and was used to test new computers.

120
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,740
Slug graduated, got a job in computer security computer security,

121
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,900
and never patented Space War! because he thought there would be no money in video games.

122
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,080
He was wrong.

123
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,000
Thanks Thought Bubble. Man, I wish I had a PDP-1 around here so I could play some Space War!

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,400
That'd be pretty sweet. Whoa! Space War! Exclamation point! Ha! I guess it's time for us to Level-Up!

125
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,060
So this is "Slug" Russell's game, and those are the two ships, the Needle and the Wedge.

126
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,400
They're inspired by ships from the pulp science fiction books that Russell loved.

127
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,280
Alright, I'm gonna just try to move my ship over here. This is 1960s' graphics

128
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,360
and video game technology, ladies and gentleman!

129
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:14,520
Behold the fascination of two small, shaped objects shooting at each other.

130
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:22,120
Alright, getting closer, getting closer, I think. I don't know, there we go. Just shoot my little -

131
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,320
Yay! I got sucked into the gravity! [Laughter] Anyway, what's really interesting about

132
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,560
Space War! is that it inspired
something called "Galaxy Game."

133
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,040
Now that was the first coin-operated video game. It was basically just Space War!,

134
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,280
but it was on a newer computer and it was housed in a fiberglass cabinet and people had to pay 10 cents to play it.

135
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,540
Oh we're coming to clip. Oh! We went into the gravity together,

136
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,740
like friends that just tried to kill each other. SPACE WAR!

137
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,780
Galaxy Game lived at the Student Union in Stanford University from 1971 through 1979

138
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,340
and large groups of students would gather together to watch this! [Laughs]

139
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:06,120
Occasionally, the school had to install closed-circuit TV screens so that people in the back could watch THIS!

140
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,780
This game! Space War! Exclamation point. Okay, this is all the Space War! I can handle.

141
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:15,660
I gotta stop now. Hey, it was a simpler time back then, but, no DLC.

142
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,500
Now, these, early examples of electronic and video games aren't interesting because they're the greatest games ever made,

143
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:28,340
I mean Space War! is okay, I guess, but it sets the stage for the explosion in video gaming

144
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,980
that we're going to be talking about next time. That explosive growth and the migration

145
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,020
of video gaming from computer labs, to arcades, to living rooms and popular culture

146
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,180
definitely has a lot to do with the human desire to turn our technology into games

147
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:45,740
and seek diversion and fun, but it also has a lot to do with the coin slot on that

148
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,720
Galaxy Game in the Stanford University Student Union, and the lines of students eager to pay to play.

149
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,520
I'm talkin' money, baby! Profit, man! That's what brought video games into the mainstream.

150
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,400
Thanks for watching, we'll see you next week.

151
