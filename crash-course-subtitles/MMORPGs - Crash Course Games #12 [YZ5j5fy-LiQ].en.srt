00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Hi, I'm AndrÃ© Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,460
Today, we're going to talk about a new kind of game that appeared in the 1990s

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,240
and leveraged the new internet technology to connect millions of players in the gaming world

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,980
where they can talk to each other, work toward completing quests, and compete or co-operate as they please.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,040
These games are called Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,800
which is too long of a phrase for me to say fourteen more times in this video, so we're just gonna call them MMORPGs.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,120
Games like these, usually found on PCs, have been nicknamed "life-games" since they lack a traditional ending.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,020
You could literally play them for life.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,200
Or at least as long as the servers are up, anyway.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,300
Today, we're gonna talk about a few of these fantasy worlds and find out why they bring us together in the real world.

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,860
So slap on that tier 18 armour and grab your companion pet, make sure your expansion pack is downloaded, and let's go!

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:51,220
[Theme Music]

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,140
In the world of gaming, we have Massively Multiplayer Online Games (or MMO games) and Roleplaying Video Games (or RPGs).

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,060
MMORPGs are obviously the combination of them both.

15
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:06,900
These games are usually hosted on servers by the game's publishers and are constantly evolving whether the player is online or not.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,520
But before we get into that, let's talk about MUD.

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,160
I don't mean mud like the kind your dog tracks in, but a MUD, or Multi-User Dungeon, which would go on to inspire modern MMORPGs.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,920
MUDs are text-based roleplaying games that have no graphics and only involve a few users.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,860
Players type in questions or commands and the game responds with written responses.

20
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,740
Using your imagination and pretending to see the adventure is a selling point.

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,560
These games are usually fantasy-based and most were inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,660
One of the most famous MUDs, called MUD, was created in the late 1970s by Roy Trubshaw on a PDP-10.

23
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:47,220
We mentioned that in an earlier episode because that's the same computer used for the invention of Galaxy Game, the world's first coin-operated video game.

24
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:54,480
MUD was simple, with players typing in N, E, S, or W for the four main directions, and words like "attack" or "defend" to battle enemies.

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,940
A few years later, those simple commands were replaced with more complex sentences like, "You were eaten by a Grue!"

26
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,480
a famous phrase that many players of the game Zork encountered time and time again.

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,880
This popular MUD sold over 680,000 copies in the first three games in its series in the 1980s.

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,580
These games emphasised leveling-up, exploration, and monster hunting, which would become a common theme in many future MMORPGs.

29
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,060
But text-based games have a limited audience because people like pretty pictures

30
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,320
and in 1986, Lucasfilm Games debuted Habitat on the Commodore 64.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:31,300
This game could support up to 10,000 players, but users could only play the game at night and on weekends when the server was running.

32
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,040
It's like an old cellphone plan.

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,200
Also, players had to play by the hour.

34
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,880
It's like old long distance charges.

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,720
In 1991, Quantum Computer Services (which would later be called AOL) debuted Neverwinter Nights, which was the first modern MMORPG.

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,500
By the time it went offline in 1997, it supported 115,000 players that paid $6 an hour to enter that world.

37
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,620
It had fighting, leveling-up, and the ability to create guilds, or like-minded groups within the game.

38
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,900
This would become a cornerstone of modern MMORPGs and the communities created within them.

39
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,120
In 1997, Ultima Online was the MMORPG that brought this game genre to the mainstream

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:14,000
reaching 100,000 subscribers in its first year and a peak user base of 250,000 active accounts in 2003.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,960
It helped that the Ultima series had been around since 1981, had 10 titles in its series, and had a huge fanbase.

42
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,300
So this brings us to that quintessential modern MMORPG -- World of Warcraft!

43
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:32,040
World of Warcraft, or WoW, has been running since 2004 and, at its height, had over 12 million active players.

44
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,760
This game is so widespread that it's played in 244 countries and territories

45
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,420
and its players have created over 500 million characters and 9 million social guilds.

46
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:49,100
Today, WoW still has 5.5 million players, which isn't too bad considering those players are still paying Blizzard $15 a month to play the game.

47
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,480
And the bonds people form in the game can even spill over into real life.

48
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,060
The New York Times ran an article in 2011 documenting multiple couples who met and married thanks to World of Warcraft.

49
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,260
And even death is also an accepted part of gaming in WoW communities.

50
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,600
In 2006, a World of Warcraft player died of a stroke in real life.

51
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,060
Her online friends chose to honour her with an in-game funeral.

52
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,440
A huge number of players showed up in formal attire and left their weapons at home out of respect.

53
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,660
A line formed so that mourners could pay their last respects to the player's avatar.

54
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:24,540
But since this is a game on the internet, things went horribly wrong when an opposing faction's guild raided the funeral and killed everyone.

55
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,560
It's a real event and one that questions the boundaries between the game world and the real world and the realm of human decency.

56
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,940
So games like WoW can say a lot about us as people, but what do they say about the systems and institutions we create?

57
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:42,040
MMORPGs have created micro-economies that have helped economists model how these systems can be adjusted for the real world.

58
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,180
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

59
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,680
Eve Online is a great example of a game as a microcosm of societal institutions.

60
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,200
This sci-fi space opera released in 2003 has an economy almost completely driven by players.

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:00,460
Eve Online has such a dynamic economy that in 2007, they hired Dr. Eyjolfur Guomundsson to be the game's lead economist.

62
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,200
He and his team acted as the game's National Economics Institute, Statistics Office, and Central Bank.

63
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,640
Describing his job as "any economist's dream, because this is not just an experiment, this is more like a simulation.

64
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,800
More like a fully-fledged system where you can input to see what happens."

65
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,840
In Eve Online, there are more than 5,000 items players can buy and sell,

66
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,760
and over 1 million transactions happen each day using in-game currency known as ISK, or Interstellar Kredits.

67
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:32,660
As of 2014, there are around 600 trillion ISK in the game which translated to around $18 million real world US dollars.

68
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,780
But since that was all player-made and tied to the creation of economic value,

69
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,740
the gamemakers could not act as a government and infuse the economy with fresh cash

70
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:47,480
so Dr Guomundsson had to find more subtle ways of balancing out the economy, like implementing broker fees, selling player skill books

71
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,220
and imposing sales tax on in-game transactions to avoid hyperinflation.

72
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,480
Also, Dr Guomundsson believes that Eve Online can be used to study monetary systems

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,900
by looking at how everything from the Gold Standard to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin can function on a grand level within the game.

74
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,560
And here we thought the game was all just about building ships and blowing them up.

75
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,780
Thanks, Thought Bubble!
And speaking of building ships and blowing them up,

76
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:14,240
Eve Online has made history for having one of the biggest and most costly in-game online battles of all time.

77
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,600
You see, spaceship costs in the game can be translated to real world money,

78
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,940
with the smallest worth around $1 to $13 US dollars and the largest as much as $7,600.

79
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:29,700
And just so we're clear, those values are based on the average hourly pay within the game across all players which can be converted to US dollars

80
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,280
because players can use real money OR in-game currency to purchase and trade play time.

81
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,820
So in 2014, a battle that would become known as Bloodbath of B-R5RB raged over two days.

82
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:48,420
And when it ended, there was over 11 trillion ISK worth of damage, or $330,000 real world dollars.

83
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,460
Now, players can make money inside the games, so most of that money wasn't spent from actual players' wallets,

84
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,860
but still, that's a lot of subscription time.

85
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,280
But real money is constantly going into these games.

86
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,840
Players routinely sell, buy, and trade gaming aspects from this game and others, even though it's forbidden.

87
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,820
This is on top of the subscription, or pay-to-play business models.

88
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,000
Gaming professor and economist Edward Castronova demonstrated in 2002

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,640
that the MMORPG Everquest was the 77th richest country on the planet, with a GDP higher than that of China's.

90
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,520
But say you don't want to spend all your time selling spiderling silk in the Bazaar.

91
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,620
There's a world out there for every type of player.

92
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,080
Sci-fi fans have Star Wars: The Old Republic.

93
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,520
Fantasy players have got Lord of the Rings Online.

94
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,820
There's even a DC Universe Online for comic book and superhero fans.

95
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,040
And the future is showing a new generation of MMORPGs.

96
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,500
Games like Guild Wars 2, Final Fantasy Online, and many others are keeping the genre alive and well.

97
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,240
A new MMORPG, No Man's Sky, comes out in 2016,

98
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,100
and according to its developer, Hello Games, offers players a chance to explore over 18 quintillion lifesize planets.

99
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,000
Each planet will have its own unique environment.

100
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,820
Sean Murray, the creator, states that,

101
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:01,020
"Even if you explore each planet once a second, our own sun will burn out before you can see them all.

102
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,700
This is all done with the power of procedural generation."

103
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,580
And rather than ending with that existential crisis, I'll leave with this -- humans have a few core drives.

104
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,260
We want to be together and we want to explore new worlds, and with MMORPGs, we get the best of both.

105
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,820
Thanks for watching. See you next time!

106
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,880
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

107
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,760
and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

108
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,620
If you'd like to keep Crash Course free for everyone forever
