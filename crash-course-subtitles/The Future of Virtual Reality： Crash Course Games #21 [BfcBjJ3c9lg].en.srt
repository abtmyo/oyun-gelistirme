00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash
Course Games.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:09,800
Today we’re going to take a look at what seems to be a cutting-edge new gaming technology that has actually been around for decades: Virtual Reality.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,540
People have been trying to create and experience truly immersive worlds like what you see in the holodeck on Star Trek for years.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,900
But none of these attempts have had any staying
power.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,900
But why is that?

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:27,140
By the looks of the huge Kickstarter out pour for the Oculus Rift VR headset in 2012, lots of players want, or at least think they want, VR Games.

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,850
And the industry has responded with headsets
from some of the largest technology giants.

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,970
But even now, we’re still in the early stages
of VR and there’s still a lot of uncertainty.

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,100
So let’s take a look at how far the technology has come and hopefully we’ll get a better idea if it’s finally here to stay.

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:48,980

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,780
Virtual Reality has actually been a recurring aspect throughout game history.

12
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,240
It attempts to deliver us a deeply enhanced experience by immersing us in the worlds that populate our games.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,100
This feeling is one of the core experiences game developers and game designers seek for their players.

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,780
The lower the barriers into the alternate realities presented by games, the easier it is for players to feel transported to another world.

15
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,360
Over the years these attempts have had varying
degrees of success to say the least.

16
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,470
Some of the very first attempts involved art
that surrounded and immersed people.

17
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:24,460
Giant, full 360 degree panoramic paintings, such as the Panorama Mesdag by Hendrik Wilhem Mesdag in 1881, have popped up throughout history.

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,540
They were found in the 12th century dynasties of China and more recently in 17th and 18th century Europe.

19
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:37,760
The term “panorama” was coined by an Irish painter, Robert Barker, to describe the massive, fully cylindrical paintings he made depicting Scotland in 1792.

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,980
And scientist Charles Wheatstone showed in 1838 how the human mind combines similar 2D imagery into 3D imagery.

21
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,380
When two identical images are placed close enough together, our mind merges them and can make them appear three-dimensional.

22
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,660
These early findings were the first stereoscopic
images.

23
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,560
They gave viewers a deep sense of immersion when they were viewed through appropriately named stereoscopes.

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,880
These handheld devices would come with images
from around the world.

25
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,390
The most famous of these devices was the 1939
View-Master by William Gruber.

26
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,160
In literature, Pygmalion’s Spectacles, written
by Stanley G. Wienbaum in 1935, describes

27
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:18,090
people of the future experiencing entirely new worlds that involve tasting food, touching fabric, and smelling flowers all through a head-mounted display.

28
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,220
And these ideas were implemented in Morton
Heilig’s 1950’s Sensorama.

29
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,940
It combined full face-immersion with a stereoscopic
3D display and also had fans, smell generators,

30
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,460
stereo speakers and even a vibrating chair
to thrust people into full sensory films like

31
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:38,340
Dune Buggy, Belly Dance, A Date with Sabrina,
and my personal favorite, I’m a Coca-Cola Bottle.

32
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,340
It wasn’t a game by any means but it was
a huge step towards immersive experiences.

33
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:49,080
Morton Heilig went on to create a new device called the Telesphere mask which really looks like a prototype Oculus Rift and was worn over the eyes.

34
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,800
And in 1968, Professor Ivan Sutherland and a student created the gigantic Sword of Damocles VR device.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:03,260
It was too heavy to be worn and had to be suspended from the ceiling but it did show basic computer-generated wireframe objects and rooms that they could exist in.

36
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,860
So as you can see virtual reality has been around for a long time, but the term Virtual Reality wasn’t coined until 1987.

37
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:17,120
The founder of the Visual Programming Lab or VPL, Jaron Lanier, used the term to describe all of the devices his company was creating.

38
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,000
They created the first VR goggles and the Dataglove that could work with the VR imagery.

39
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:24,820
About this time VR began to get noticed by
the public thanks to the Virtuality Group.

40
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,949
VR could be found in various public arenas,
most commonly in local malls.

41
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:34,740
The company created many arcade games and VR machines that could hold multiple players in one contiguous virtual space.

42
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:42,040
Players would strap into large, bulky chairs, otherwise known as VR-Pods, and then don massive, neck-breaking, head mounted displays.

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,400
And the games pretty weird.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:52,079
Like, Dactyl Nightmare: up to 4 players bounced around a series of floating, checker-bordered platforms, while dodging the neon-green pterodactyls that swooped around them.

45
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,379
That was a game.

46
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,680
VR also showed up in the home console markets.

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,160
One of the earliest attempts was the 3D-Imager peripheral for the Vectrex console released in 1984.

48
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,120
But it was retired the same year it was released due to the Great Video Game Crash of North America.

49
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:16,380
Almost a decade later, Sega actually tried to start a new VR craze when it debuted the Sega VR headset for the Sega Genesis at the 1993 Consumer Electronics Show, but it was never released.

50
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:25,800
Sega claimed that the experience was going to be too “real” for audience but it has been reported that the limited processing power of the Sega systems at the time could not adequately create a feasible 3D experience.

51
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,380
And the next major entry in console gaming VR: the Nintendo Virtual Boy, released in 1995.

52
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:38,340
The device, also known as the VR-32, was famous, or infamous, for its games with only two colors, black and red.

53
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,460
It cost around $180 and had very few games.

54
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,180
Players also reported that the Virtual Boy caused headaches and eyestrain, sometimes for up to an hour after playing.

55
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,520
The Virtual Boy was discontinued 1 year after
its release.

56
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,120
And that seemed like the end of consumer VR.

57
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,360
But in recent years, the technology has come thundering back with the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive, and the Playstation VR.

58
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,979
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

59
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:08,340
In 2011, 18 year old inventor Palmer Luckey was frustrated with the existing selection of head-mounted displays for gaming, so he decided to build his own.

60
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,480
He debuted the Oculus Rift on Kickstarter
in 2012.

61
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:19,080
And with the vocal support of ID Software’s John Carmack, the father of First Person Shooters, quickly raised $2.5 million dollars,

62
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,840
proving once again that there was still an audience that wanted this whole VR thing to work out.

63
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:30,520
By 2014, Facebook purchased Oculus for $2 billion dollars, and the Rift was officially released in March of 2016.

64
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:39,100
The Rift notably included much higher resolution displays, a wider field of view, and a significantly reduced lag time, which produced a much less nauseating experience.

65
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:45,820
The industry quickly followed with HTC’s release of the Vive in April of 2016 in partnership with the Valve Corporation.

66
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,100
The Vive platform encourages open development
through the Steam Workshop and utilizes a

67
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,740
novel room scale technology that seems like it’ll have a lot of important uses like keeping players from running into walls.

68
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,340
Gaming behemoth Sony also will launch its own headset, the PlayStation VR, in October of 2016.

69
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,159
The device will work with a Playstation 4,
significantly lowering the price barrier,

70
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,540
as compared to the other headsets that require
a more expensive PC to process the graphics.

71
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:18,460
The Playstation VR is also in an interesting position as it will be able to leverage its existing developer relationships and current install base to bring lots of new players and games to the VR genre.

72
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,600
Thanks Thought Bubble!

73
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,300
And did those devices seem expensive to you?

74
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,780
Well, there are more affordable VR devices
on the market, like Google’s Cardboard.

75
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,080
And that’s just not a name -- the Cardboard
is just that cardboard.

76
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,620
It’s an inexpensive viewing device that
turns a smartphone into a VR viewer.

77
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,980
Google’s goal with this low-cost device
is to encourage development for VR applications.

78
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,800
And their efforts seem to be successful as there are now over 1,000 applications compatible with the Cardboard.

79
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,860
But Google’s is not the only contender for
phone based VR.

80
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,260
Samsung has teamed up with Oculus to create a VR headset that is compatible with their Galaxy phones.

81
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:54,440
This device serves as a consumer friendly headset that will only set you back about $100 as opposed to Oculus’ $600.

82
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,680
Granted you still need to purchase the phone
too.

83
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,900
That’s where they get you.

84
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:01,039
VR is also starting to expand into other entertainment
experiences.

85
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,219
Amusement parks are now starting to integrate
VR with their rides.

86
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,879
Six Flags just opened their newest VR coaster,
The New Revolution, which promises a complete

87
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:17,540
immersive experience combining the physical sensation of the coaster with a VR experience that will place you “in a futuristic battle to save the planet from an alien invasion.”

88
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,860
There’s even a virtual reality theme park called The Void being built in Pleasant Grove, Utah.

89
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,139
The Void will be a mixed reality attraction
dedicated to VR experiences that blend VR

90
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,320
with physical environments and haptic feedback to provide a convincing virtual world that employs even more of your senses!

91
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,860
All that and we haven’t even talked about Augmented Reality Games - games that are overlaid on the real world.

92
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,660
These games aren’t exactly virtual reality,
but are very closely related.

93
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,610
The most notable one right now is of course
Pokemon Go.

94
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,789
Sorry Pickachu.
I’ll catch you later.

95
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:52,460
So with all these advances in VR gaming, new and actually pretty convincing worlds are forming inside these game spaces.

96
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,780
And yes, there are still some existing problems like the field of view on these devices isn’t quite as wide as it should be.

97
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,020
And players have to be tethered to large,
heavy computers.

98
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,760
And we still haven’t quite figured out how best for a player to move around in a small room.

99
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,020
But it’s VR!
It’s so cool!

100
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,900
And at the same time these VR experiences are growing rapidly in player adoption and immersion capabilities.

101
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,720
Never before have we been able to participate
in these worlds as we can today.

102
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:22,720
And with the continued improvements in technology as well as seemingly huge selection of games on the horizon, virtual reality might, MAYBE, be here to stay.

103
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,420
Only time will tell. Thanks for watching
and we’ll see you next time. Either real or virtually.

104
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,400
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and
Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana.

105
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
And it's made with the help of all these nice
people.

106
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,380
If you'd like to keep Crash Course free for
everyone forever, you can support the series

107
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,280
at Patreon, a crowdfunding platform that allows
you to support the content you love.

108
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,820
Speaking of Patreon, we'd like to thank all
