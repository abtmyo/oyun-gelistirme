00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Hi, I'm Andre Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,260
Today we're gonna talk about the second half of the 1980s,

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,660
when the video game industry was reborn, largely due to the influence of Nintendo.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,360
Now, after the great North American video game crash in 1983, which was called "The Atari Shock" in Japan,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,540
the video game console industry in the United States was crushed!

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,600
"Odyssey", "Colecovision", "Intellivision" and others left the marketplace. "Atari" was sold off.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,060
The U.S. home console and cartridge market, which was worth nearly 3 billion dollars in 1982,

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,340
fell to 100 million dollars in 1985, according to Nintendo of America.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,500
And those numbers aren't adjusted for inflation!

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,580
The number of console games produced also dropped dramatically.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,820
But at the same time,
the home computer market was growing,

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,000
and video games for the Commodore 64 and Apple II looked like the future of gaming

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,380
So much, in fact, that "Video Games Player" magazine changed their name to "Computer Games" ... traitors!

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,220
But the video game crash that we talked about last time, happening in the United States, didn't happen in Japan.

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,660
And Nintendo, which started as a playing card company, would bring video gaming back.

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,060
How did they start? And what changed everything in the Mid-'80s?

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,940
Well, grab a hold of your plumber's hat, your Triforce, and don't get turned into an eggplant - cause we're gonna find out!

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:19,740
[Theme Music]

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:26,100
Nintendo was founded in 1889 (Now, that's old-school!) by a young Fusajiro Yamauchi,

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,420
to distribute his handmade playing cards.

21
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,420
For eight decades, Nintendo made cards and toys.

22
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,620
And the company still produces a line of playing cards today, but mostly as a tribute to its past.

23
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,220
Nintendo broke into the video game market in the 1970s,

24
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,020
when they won the rights to distribute the original Magnavox Odyssey console in Japan.

25
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:48,240
They developed a string of arcade hits with "Donkey Kong", "Ice Climbers" and "Mario Bros.", and then turned to handheld games.

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,280
The "Game & Watch" handhelds were one of their first hardware products, and they were extremely popular;

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,800
the other reason you have that little 2D silhouette - Mr. Game & Watch - in your Smash Bros. games.

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,500
Nintendo's experience in licensing the "Odyssey", plus its success with the Game & Watch handheld,

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,100
led the company to develop a new game console for the Japanese market,

30
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,720
which had been relatively untouched in the crash. Let's go to the Thought Bubble!

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,660
Nintendo's new console debuted in Japan as the brightly colored, red-and-white "Famicom"

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,960
or "Family Computer Home Gaming Console".

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,340
It sold more than 2.5 million copies by 1985, which led Nintendo to consider the North American market.

34
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,620
In 1985, the company introduced the Nintendo Entertainment System, or "NES".

35
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,620
They were so wary of backlash from the crash and competition from the home computer markets,

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,080
that they removed all mentions of video games.

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,960
To distance the product from the recent industry crash, they invented a whole new vocabulary.

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,540
Consoles were called "Control Decks", and game cartridges were called "Game Packs".

39
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,600
The system was colored gray, so it looked like a serious computing device.

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,520
It loaded games from the front, like a VCR, and not top-down like previous consoles.

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,200
They sold the device in toy stores rather than electronic stores, and made no-risk deals with American retailers.

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,800
The system had a pretty sweet futuristic light gun, known as the "NES Zapper",

43
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,060
(Take that, "Duck Hunt"!) and R.O.B., the "Robotic Operating Buddy", who seemed cool but only played two games.

44
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,760
It was really the consumer response, they made the NES succeed.

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,140
Nintendo's surveys of people who bought the system in the New York City Area in 1985

46
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,700
indicated that more than 90% of those who bought the NES would recommend it to friends and family.

47
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,820
One year after the NES debuted, Nintendo sold over 1.8 million units.

48
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,600
By 1989, Nintendo had a 75-80% share of the 3.4 billion dollar U.S. video game market.

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,700
It was clear that the U.S. gaming industry had returned, and Nintendo was Player One. Thanks, Thought Bubble!

50
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,660
Nintendo's real success, though, was its ability to create a culture around itself and its games.

51
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,360
The first thing they did was to ensure they wouldn't make the mistakes of the past.

52
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:45,700
Atari suffered because they didn't monitor third-party developers, some of which made terrible, rushed games that flooded the market.

53
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,540
That's one of the reasons why we had the crash.

54
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:53,660
So Nintendo tightly controlled the games that appeared on its system with the official "Seal of Quality".

55
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,880
These golden seals told players that they held a quality product.

56
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,620
Nintendo wouldn't let Third Party developers make NES games unless they agreed to a contract

57
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,140
to make games only for Nintendo for two years and to only make five games a year for the system.

58
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,060
These were seen as quality controls.

59
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,760
They enforced this with a special computer chip called the "10NES"

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,000
that controlled what games would work on the system.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,900
Though, later, developers got around them.

62
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,440
This allowed for quality games that created loyalty in the fanbase.

63
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,100
Players trusted that Nintendo games would be fun, look great and would actually work.

64
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,200
... with some exceptions... LJN...

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,940
Nintendo also encouraged the loyalty of its customers by creating the "Nintendo Fun Club",

66
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,660
which sent users a newsletter with gameplay tips and news about popular and upcoming games.

67
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,780
The newsletter was a success. With subscriptions nearing 600,000 by the end of 1987.

68
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,320
They replaced this newsletter with "Nintendo Power" magazine in 1988.

69
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,520
In Nintendo Power, you could write letters to the editor, enter contests, get exclusive merch and comics,

70
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,160
get advice from gameplay counsellors...

71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
This helped create a special Nintendo community for players to exist.

72
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,060
And the crucial element of Nintendo's success was the quality of its games.

73
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,000
Advanced technology allowed for more detailed graphics and sound, and longer and more complex games.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,700
Games like "Super Mario Bros.", "Legend of Zelda", "Kid Icarus" and "Metroid"

75
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,380
captivated players and gave them hours of gameplay.

76
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,360
Characters like "Q*bert" and "Pac-Man" were cute, but they didn't have a lot of back story.

77
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,480
Mario and Luigi, from "Super Mario Bros.", were plumbers running around the Mushroom Kingdom

78
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,300
trying to save Princess Peach, or "Princess Toadstool" back then, from Bowser, King of the Koopas.

79
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,600
Okay, it's not like it's Les MisÃ©rables or anything,

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,500
but it was something for players to get attached to and connect with.

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,720
And audiences definitely connected with the game,

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,360
"Super Mario Bros." has sold over 40 million copies since its release.

83
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,260
Now, while the Super Mario Bros. were hopping around the Mushroom Kingdom,

84
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,180
"The Legend of Zelda" opened the world of Hyrule to players.

85
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,120
The game had varied environments, like forests, deserts and dungeons, that unfolded in every direction.

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,460
Now, while Mario constantly moved from left to right in his race to save the princess from the evil beast, Bowser,

87
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,700
players could move Link in any direction on his quest to save Princess Zelda from the evil beast Ganon.

88
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,100
Nintendo had a thing for saving princesses from evil beasts.

89
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,840
This sense of exploring a giant video game world was also new to players.

90
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,400
In The Legend of Zelda the aduience
was in charge of the pace of play.

91
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,800
They could go where they wanted and take as much time as they wanted in the land of Hyrule.

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,640
In Metroid, Samus explored the open-ended planet of Zebes, with an entire ecosystem of Metroids and other aliens to fight.

93
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,400
This complex game had multiple endings, and areas that were only accessible after players found certain power-ups.

94
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,240
And speaking of Metroid, we're gonna play a little bit right now.

95
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,920
So, watch out, Mother Brain! It's time to level up!

96
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,100
Ooooh!
Listen to that eerie music! Whooo!

97
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,240
That was what was interesting about Metroid:
Unlike some of the other NES games,

98
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,720
Metroid had this dark, eerie feel and the music played a large part in that.

99
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,560
All right, I'm gonna jump right into this.
But which way do I go?! [CHUCKLES]

100
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,000
So you could go left, you could go right, up, down...

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,240
Because they were open-world, you had these giant maps as part of the game.

102
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,780
And that's why Nintendo Power was such a big deal, because you could get secret information from Nintendo Power,

103
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,520
that you couldn't find anywhere else, on how to play some of these games.

104
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,500
Aaah!
[Laughter]

105
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,960
Back off, man, back off!

106
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,540
No!
[Laughter]

107
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,860
Now I'm just casually playing through the game but what's interesting about games like "Metroid"

108
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,320
is that people have played them so many times and know the maps so well

109
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,740
that they've actually started doing "Speed Runs", where they'll just try to get through it as fast as possible.

110
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,060
And the reason why you even had speed runners, or just people being able to find every single secret in the game,

111
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,320
is because you had this nice home experience of playing these games.

112
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,700
And another reason that "Metroid" had replayability was because it had five different endings.

113
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,460
And what was very fascinating about some of those endings was that it revealed

114
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,700
something that we all know now but didn't know back then: That Samus is female!

115
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,660
She gets to join the ranks with Ms. Pac-Man.

116
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,000
So, that's Metroid. I guess Mother Brain is gonna live another day 'cause we're gonna move on

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,420
but it's definitely fun to revisit this game.

118
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,720
Metroid, Super Mario Bros., Duck Hunt, Kid Icarus, The Legend of Zelda...

119
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,180
Nintendo brought gaming back with excitement. And Excite Bike!

120
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,900
And a level of commitment to quality that brought the video game industry back from the brink.

121
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,080
Nintendo's games showcased improvements in underlining game technology

122
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,360
but they also reflected a maturing industry.

123
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,320
With these new tools, game designers created immersive worlds and empowered players as never before.

124
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,040
To borrow Nintendo's trademark advertising slogan: "Now you're playing with power!"

125
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,640
But Nintendo won't be alone in the video game race for long,

126
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,480
thanks to another company with a little blue hedgehog. We'll see you next time!

127
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,580
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana,

128
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,620
and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

129
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,100
