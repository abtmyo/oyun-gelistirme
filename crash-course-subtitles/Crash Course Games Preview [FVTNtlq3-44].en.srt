00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,620

00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,440
Hi I'm Andre Meadows and welcome to Crash Course Games!

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,860
Over the next twenty weeks, we're going to have some fun.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,880
I mean Crash Course is *always* fun but this
time we're gonna have fun talking about games.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,820
Now of course we're gonna talk about video games:

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,180
your Ataris, your Nintendos, your Sega Genesiseses, your Play Stations, your XBOXs.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,020
But not just video games - also hand held games
mobile games, tabletop games, board games,

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,120
card games, sports games, virtual reality games

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,960
Even games going as far back as Ancient Egypt and China games you might not have ever heard of before,

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,220
but mechanics in those games that're still prevalent in games today!

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,540
That's a lot of games! But before we get in all these games, allow me to introduce myself.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,060
My name is Andre! Ever since I was a little kid I was into computer and video games.

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,280
I used to have a Nintendo Entertainment system - of course - before that I had an Atari 2600.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,460
And before that, I had a Texas Instrument TI994A.
Nerd cred!

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,100
And today I have my own Youtube channel
Black Nerd Comedy where I talk about all kinds of

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:04,700
retro, nostalgia, pop and geek culture goodness like TV shows, movies, cartoons and of course: video games.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,220
Now video games might be a leisure activity but unlike what your parents told you

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,060
when you were a kid, or today, as a kid — or adult —
they are NOT a waste of time!

20
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,060
You know, video games that we play, they have a lot to tell us about the experiences of being human.

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,220
As a matter of fact, humans have been playing games pretty much as long as there have been humans.

22
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,900
And I can tell you, the stakes have changed a little since ancient times:

23
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,120
I mean, I hate coming in last in Mario Kart as much as the next guy,

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,980
But in Ancient Egypt, if you were bad at games

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,920
You could end up in Ancient Egyptian Hell...

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,680
which is kinda like Rainbow Road.

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,540
So in this series we're gonna play some games, we're gonna talk some history, maybe some science,

28
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,000
even look into gaming's future, and above all we're gonna have some fun

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,280
learning about this universal human behavior:
People playing games.
